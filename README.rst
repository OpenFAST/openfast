OpenFAST is a wind turbine simulation tool which builds on FAST v8. It was
created with the goal of being a community model developed and used by research
laboratories, academia, and industry. It is managed by a dedicated team at the
National Renewable Energy Lab. Our objective is to ensure that OpenFAST is
sustainable software that is well tested and well documented. If you'd like
to contribute, see the `Developer Documentation <https://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/dev/source/dev/index.html>`_
and any open GitHub issues with the
`Help Wanted <https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"Help+wanted">`_
tag.

**OpenFAST is under active development**.

FAST v8 - OpenFAST v0.1.0
-------------------------
The transition from FAST v8 to OpenFAST v0.1.0 represents the effort to better
support an open-source developer community around FAST-based aero-hydro-servo-
elastic engineering models of wind-turbines and wind-plants. OpenFAST is the
next generation of FAST analysis tools. More inforation is available in the
`transition notes <http://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user/fast_to_openfast.html>`_.

FAST v8 is a computer-aided engineering tool for simulating the coupled dynamic
response of wind turbines. FAST joins aerodynamics models, hydrodynamics models
for offshore structures, control and electrical system (servo) dynamics models,
and structural (elastic) dynamics models to enable coupled nonlinear aero-
hydro-servo-elastic simulation in the time domain. The FAST tool enables the
analysis of a range of wind turbine configurations, including two- or
three-blade horizontal-axis rotor, pitch or stall regulation, rigid or
teetering hub, upwind or downwind rotor, and lattice or tubular tower. The wind
turbine can be modeled on land or offshore on fixed-bottom or floating
substructures. FAST is based on advanced engineering models derived from
fundamental laws, but with appropriate simplifications and assumptions, and
supplemented where applicable with computational solutions and test data.

The aerodynamic models use wind-inflow data and solve for the rotor-wake
effects and blade-element aerodynamic loads, including dynamic stall. The
hydrodynamics models simulate the regular or irregular incident waves and
currents and solve for the hydrostatic, radiation, diffraction, and viscous
loads on the offshore substructure. The control and electrical system models
simulate the controller logic, sensors, and actuators of the blade-pitch,
generator-torque, nacelle-yaw, and other control devices, as well as the
generator and power-converter components of the electrical drive. The
structural-dynamics models apply the control and electrical system
reactions, apply the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads, adds gravitational
loads, and simulate the elasticity of the rotor, drivetrain, and support
structure. Coupling between all models is achieved through a modular
interface and coupler.

Documentation
-------------
The full documentation is available at http://openfast.readthedocs.io/.

This documentation is stored and maintained alongside the source code.
It is compiled into HTML with Sphinx and is tied to a particular version
of OpenFAST. `Readthedocs <http://openfast.readthedocs.io>`_ hosts the following
versions of the documentation:

* ``latest`` - The latest commit on the ``master`` branch
* ``stable`` - Corresponds to the last tagged release
* ``dev`` - The latest commit on the ``dev`` branch

These can be toggled with the ``v: latest`` button in the lower left corner of
the docs site.

Obtaining OpenFAST
------------------
OpenFAST is hosted entirely on GitHub so you are in the `right place <https://github.com/OpenFAST/OpenFAST>`_!
The repository is structured with two branches following the
"git-flow" convention:

* ``master``
* ``dev``

The ``master`` branch is stable, well tested, and represents the most up to
date released version of OpenFAST. The latest commit on ``master`` contains
a tag with version info and brief release notes. The tag history can be
obtained with the ``git tag`` command and viewed in more detail on
`GitHub Releases <https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast/releases>`_. For general
use, the ``master`` branch is highly recommended.

The ``dev`` branch is generally stable and tested, but not static. It contains
new features, bug fixes, and documentation updates that have not been compiled
into a production release. Before proceeding with new development, it is
recommended to explore the ``dev`` branch. This branch is updated regularly
through pull requests, so be sure to ``git fetch`` often and check
`outstanding pull requests <https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast/pulls>`_.

Compilation, Usage, and Development
-----------------------------------
Details for compiling
`compiling <http://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/install/index.html>`_,
`using <http://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user/index.html>`_, and
`developing <http://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/dev/index.html>`_
OpenFAST on Unux-based and Windows machines are available at `readthedocs <http://openfast.readthedocs.io>`_.

Nightly Testing
---------------
The ``dev`` branch is automatically compiled and run through the test suite
nightly. The results are publicly available through the
`CDash Dashboard <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=OpenFAST&date=>`_.
