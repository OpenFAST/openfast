# OpenFAST linearization tests
# Dont run these in parallel, copying the case files can fail in a race condition
# Exclude the Ideal_Beam test cases
# - They fail consistently in the Docker container when run on GitHub,
#   but pass everywhere else including running the same Docker image locally

# Subset of OpenFAST regression tests; do not run
# - 9, 16 because they're very sensitive
# - 19, 20 because they're too long
