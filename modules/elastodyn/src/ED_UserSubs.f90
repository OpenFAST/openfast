   !          ------------  ---------------------------------------------------
   !          UserRFrl()    User-specified rotor-furl spring/damper model.

   !       In order to interface ElastoDyn with your own user-specified routines,
   !       you can develop your own logic within these dummy placeholders and
   !       recompile; We recommend that you do not use these files, as they do not

SUBROUTINE UserRFrl ( RFrlDef, RFrlRate, ZTime, DirRoot, RFrlMom )


   ! This is a dummy routine for holding the place of a user-specified
   ! rotor-furl spring/damper.  Modify this code to create your own device.

   ! NOTE: If you (the user) wants to switch on-or-off the rotor-furl DOF at
   !       runtime from this user-defined routine, then do the following:
   !          (1) USE MODULE DOFs().
   !          (2) Type in "DOF_Flag(DOF_RFrl) = VALUE" where VALUE = .TRUE. or
   !              .FALSE. depending on whether you want to turn-on or turn-off
   !              the DOF, respectively.  Turning off the DOF forces the
   !              current RATE to remain fixed.  If the rate is currently zero,
   !              the current POSITION will remain fixed as well.
   !       This technique is useful, for example, if the rotor-furl hinge has
   !       an electromagnetic latch that will unlock and relock the hinge under
   !       certain specified conditions.
   !       Note that this technique WILL NOT work for user-defined routines
   !       written for ADAMS datasets extracted using the FAST-to-ADAMS
   !       preprocessor.
