# IceDyn Module
The legacy version of this module and additional documentation are available
the [NWTC Software Portal](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/IceDyn/).

## Overview
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the University of Michigan a
project to create a model for interaction of bottom-fixed offshore wind
turbines with surface ice for use with common simulation tools. The IceDyn
module, which conforms to the standards of the FAST Modularization Framework,
was created from this project.

The IceDyn module includes 6 ice mechanics models that incorporate ice floe
forcing, deformation and failure and structure geometry. The six models are
- quasi-static ice loading on vertical structure
- dynamic ice loading on vertical structure
- random ice loading on vertical structure
- non-simultaneous ice loading on vertical structure
- ice loading on sloping structure
- large ice floe impact
