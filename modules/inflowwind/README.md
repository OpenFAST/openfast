# InflowWind Module
The legacy version of this module and additional documentation are available
at the [NWTC Software Portal](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/InflowWind/).

## Overview
InflowWind is a module for processing wind-inflow data. It has been coupled
into the OpenFAST multi-physics engineering tool to enable aero-elastic
simulation of horizontal-axis wind turbines. InflowWind can also be driven
as a standalone code to process wind-inflow data uncoupled from OpenFAST.
