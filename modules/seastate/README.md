# SeaState Module
The legacy version of this module was incorporated within the HydroDyn module.  Additional documentation are available
at the [NWTC Software Portal](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/HydroDyn/).

## Overview
SeaState is a module for modeling hydrodynamics. It has been coupled
into the OpenFAST multi-physics engineering tool to enable hydrodynamic
simulation of horizontal-axis wind turbines. SeaState can also be driven
as a standalone code to generate wave elevation and kinematic data uncoupled from OpenFAST.
