 Input file read complete.

 Load time series duration = 600 sec

 Setting common ice flow input parameters
 Ice type = 7
 Ice thickness = 1 meters
 Ice velocity = 0.2 m/s
 Ice direction = 0 degrees
 Time step = 0.1 sec
 Tower diameter = 5 meters
 Random seed = 123

 Setting common flexural failure input parameters
 flexStrength = 7.00000E+05 Pascals
 towerConeAngle = 60 degrees
 ice2twrFriction = 0.15
 iceDensity = 916.2 kg/m^3
 Breaking term, Hb term is included
 Rubble pushing term, Hr term is included

 Setting up flexural failure by Ralston method
 Use the IEC 61400-3 suggested equations for max static loads
 Ride up thickness = 2.5 meters
 Tower cone top diameter = 1.5 meters
 Frequency parameter K = 5
** Maximum static load for flexural failure = 3.74475E+06Newtons

 IEC/Ralston ice flexural failure loads initialized
