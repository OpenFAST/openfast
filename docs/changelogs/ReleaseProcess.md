****

## Posting the release
### r-test
1. Merge and add annotated tag
2. Update pointer on main OF repository (not always necessary)

### Main repository
1. Merge PR
2. Create release with new tag
   * Copy `Changelog` section down from the changlog.md file to release notes
   * add short intro section at top with 2 sentence synopsis (see prior release for this)
   * copy `Precompiled Windows Binaries` section from prior release, and update as needed into the release notes
   * check the `create discussion` box
   * Post
3. delete `rc-` branch if merging from one

### Windows executables build and upload
After posting and tagging release
1. Pull main and tags
   * `git fetch --tags OpenFAST`
   * `git fetch OpenFAST main:main`
   * `git checkout main`
2. Delete `vs-build` and checkout again
   * `rm -rf vs-build`
   * `git checkout vs-build`
3. Set a couple of VS files to not track changes on files that VS wants to update Windows related stuff in
   ```
   git update-index --assume-unchanged vs-build/MAPlib/MAP_dll.vcxproj vs-uild/Registry/FAST_Registry.vcxproj
   ```

4. Compile executables for Windows builds
   * Run one of the executables and check the version info. Muck about with VS if there is an issue.
   * Also run `dumpbin.exe /dependents <exe>.exe` to check static linking
   * NOTE: build the simulink last -- it messes up some things otherwise
