# Release Notes

OpenFAST 3.4.1 is a minor release to revert a channel name change in AeroDyn 15.  This also contains minor fixes for documentation builds.

### Documentation
#1442 `[BugFix] Doxygen builds failing on rtd, and locally.   Documentation builds on readthedocs and local were failing due to a change in the backend of sphinx.  This fixes local builds, but does not fix readthedocs builds.  As a temporary workaround, doxygen is disabled on readthedocs.

### AeroDyn15
#1428 AD15: revert to Aero names for output channels (Fld is now an alias).  This fixes an issue introduced in v3.4.0 (#957)
