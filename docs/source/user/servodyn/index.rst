ServoDyn Users Guide
====================

This document offers a quick reference guide for the ServoDyn software
program. It is intended to be used by the general user in combination
with other OpenFAST manuals. The manual will be updated as new releases are
issued and as needed to provide further information on advancements or
modifications to the software.

The Structural control sub-module of ServoDyn is documented in :numref:`StC`.

**The documentation here is incomplete.**
Much more documentation for this module is available in the
FAST v6 User's Guide as well as small updates in the
FAST v8 README. These references can be downloaded in
section :numref:`general-reference-docs`.
