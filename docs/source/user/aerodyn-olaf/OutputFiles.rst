Output Files
============

The OLAF module itself does not produce its own output file. However, additional
output channels are made available in *AeroDyn15*. As such, the *AeroDyn15*
output file is briefly described as well as the outputs made available with
OLAF. Visualization files are generated by using the parameter, **WrVTK**.  This
parameter is available in the OLAF input file, in which case the VTK files are
written to the folder ``vtk_fvw``, or the primary ``.fst`` file, in which case
the VTK files are written to the folder ``vtk``.

Velocity field outputs can be exported as VTK files. The user can control these
outputs using **nGridOut** and the subsequent table.


Results File
------------

OpenFAST generates a master results file that includes the *AeroDyn15*
results. The results are in table format, where each column is a data
channel, and each row corresponds to a simulation-output time step. The
data channels are specified in the *OUTPUTS* section in the *AeroDyn15*
primary input file. The column format of the AeroDyn-generated files is
specified using the **OutFmt** parameter of the OpenFAST driver input
file.
