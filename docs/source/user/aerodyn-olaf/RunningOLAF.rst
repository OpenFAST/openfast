Running OLAF
============

As OLAF is a module of OpenFAST, the process of downloading, compiling,
and running OLAF is the same as that for OpenFAST. Such instructions are
available in the :ref:`installation` documentation.

.. note::
   To improve the speed of FVW module, the user may wish to compile with
   `OpenMP`.  To do so, add the `-DOPENMP=ON` option with CMake.
