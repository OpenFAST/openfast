User Documentation
==================

This section contains documentation for the OpenFAST module-coupling environment and its underlying modules.
Documentation covers usage of models, underlying theory, and in some cases module verification.

We are in the process of transitioning legacy FAST v8 documentation, which can be found at https://nwtc.nrel.gov/.
Details on the transition from FAST v8 to OpenFAST may be found in :numref:`fast_to_openfast`
