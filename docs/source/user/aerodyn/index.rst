AeroDyn Users Guide and Theory Manual
======================================

This document offers a quick reference guide for the AeroDyn software
program. It is intended to be used by the general user in combination
with other OpenFAST manuals. The manual will be updated as new releases are
issued and as needed to provide further information on advancements or
modifications to the software. For reference, additional materials
such as presentation slides, development plans, and publications
can be downladed from the list below.
