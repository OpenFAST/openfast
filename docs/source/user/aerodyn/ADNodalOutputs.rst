Nodal Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the named outputs in :numref:`AD-Outputs` above, AeroDyn allows
for outputting the full set blade node motions and loads (tower nodes
unavailable at present). Please refer to the AeroDyn_Nodes tab in the
Excel file :download:`OutListParameters.xlsx <../../../OtherSupporting/OutListParameters.xlsx>`
for a complete list of possible output parameters.

This section follows the `END` statement from normal Outputs section described
above, and includes a separator description line followed by the following
optinos.

**BldNd_BladesOut** specifies the number of blades to output. Possible values
are 0 through the number of blades AeroDyn is modeling. If the value is set to
1, only blade 1 will be output, and if the value is 2, blades 1 and 2 will be
output.

**BldNd_BlOutNd** specifies which nodes to output.  This is currently unused.

The **OutList** section controls the nodal output quantities generated by
AeroDyn. In this section, the user specifies the name of the channel family to
output. The output name for each channel is then created internally by AeroDyn
by combining the blade number, node number, and channel family name. For
example, if the user specifies **AxInd** as the channel family name, the output
channels will be named with the convention of **B**\ :math:`\mathbf{\beta}`\
**N###AxInd** where :math:`\mathbf{\beta}` is the blade number, and **###** is
the three digit node number.
