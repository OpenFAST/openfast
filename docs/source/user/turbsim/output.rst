HAWC Full-Field Files
---------------------------------------------------

When TurbSim is requested to write HAWC-formatted output files (``WrHAWCFF=TRUE``), it will generate four files. ``<RootName>-u.bin``, 
``<RootName>-v.bin``, and ``<RootName>-w.bin`` are binary files that contain the full-field turbulence data for the 3 wind-speed components.
``<RootName>.HAWC`` is a text summary file that indicates the number of points in the binary files and how they should be scaled. The data 
in this file is written in a format that can be copied into a HAWC2 input file.


Notes: 

1. The ``factor_scaling`` values in the summary file indicate the inverse of the values TurbSim used to scale the data in the HAWC files.
   ``factor_scaling`` can theoretically be used in HAWC2 to obtain the original data generated by TurbSim.
   TurbSim scales the data so that HAWC2 will obtain the standard-deviation ratios of 1.0 (u/u), 0.8 (v/u), and 0.5 (w/u) as a work-around for
   an issue in how HAWC2 scales turbulence files. Please note that these ratios may not work well with non-IEC turbulence models.

2. HAWC-formatted files are always periodic, so all of the analysis time steps are written.
   
3. The u-component wind speed files have the mean *hub-height* wind speed removed, so they will contain any shear that was defined.
   
4. For HAWC2 simulations, it is recommended that TurbSim be run without shear (``PLExp=0``) and without any mean flow angles (``VFlowAng=0``,
   ``HFlowAng=0``). These values can instead be added in the HAWC2 input file or in the InflowWind input file for OpenFAST.
