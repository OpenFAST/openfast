.. _AeroAcoustics:

Aeroacoustics Noise Model of OpenFAST
=====================================

.. only:: html

   This report describes theory and application of a newly released model
   of OpenFAST to simulate the aeroacoustics noise generated by the rotor
   of an arbitrary wind turbine. OpenFAST is a fully open-source, publicly
   available wind turbine analysis tool actively developed at the National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory. The aeroacoustics model, which is also
   fully open source and publicly available, is based on work performed
   over the past three decades. Frequency-based models for turbulent
   inflow; turbulent boundary layer – trailing edge; laminar boundary layer
   – vortex shedding; tip vortex; and trailing edge bluntness – vortex
   shedding noise mechanisms are included. A simple directivity model is
   also included.

   The noise models are exercised simulating the aeroacoustics noise
   emissions of the International Energy Agency Wind Task 37 land-based
   reference wind turbine. A code-to-code comparison between the
   implementation presented here and the implementation available at the
   Wind Energy Institute of the Technical University of Munich, Germany, is
   also presented.
