Input Files
===========

The user configures the hydrodynamic model parameters as well as the
substructure geometry and properties via a primary HydroDyn input file.
When used in standalone mode, an additional driver input file is
required. This driver file specifies initialization inputs normally
provided to HydroDyn by OpenFAST, as well as the per-time-step inputs to
HydroDyn.

No lines should be added or removed from the input files, except in
tables where the number of rows is specified.

Units
~~~~~
HydroDyn uses the SI system (kg, m, s, N).

.. _hd-driver-input:

HydroDyn Driver Input File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The driver input file is only needed for the standalone version of
HydroDyn and contains inputs normally generated by OpenFAST, and are
necessary to control the hydrodynamic simulation for uncoupled models. A
sample HydroDyn driver input file is given in Appendix B.

Set the **Echo** flag in this file to TRUE if you wish to have
``HydroDynDriver`` echo the contents of the driver input file (useful
for debugging errors in the driver file). The echo file has the naming
convention of ``OutRootName.dvr.ech``. **OutRootName** is specified
in the HYDRODYN section of the driver input file. Set the gravity
constant using the **Gravity** parameter. HydroDyn expects a magnitude,
so in SI units this would be set to 9.80665 :math:`\frac{m}{s^{2}}`.
**WtrDens** specifies the water density and must be a value greater than
or equal to zero; a typical value of seawater is around 1025
kg/m\ :sup:`3`. **WtrDpth** specifies the water depth (depth of the flat
seabed), based on the reference MSL, and must be a value greater than
zero. **MSL2SWL** is the offset between the MSL and SWL, positive
upward. This parameter is useful when simulating the effect of tides or
storm-surge sea-level variations without having to alter the
substructure geometry information. This parameter is unused with
**WaveMod** = 6 and must be set to zero if you are using a
potential-flow model (**PotMod** = 1 or 2). **WaveMod** and **PotMod** are 
specified in the HydroDyn primary input file.

**HDInputFile** is the filename of the primary HydroDyn input file. This
name should be in quotations and can contain an absolute path or a
relative path. All HydroDyn-generated output files will be prefixed with
**OutRootName**. If this parameter includes a file path, the output will
be generated in that folder. **NSteps** specifies the number of
simulation time steps, and **TimeInterval** specifies the time between
steps.

Setting **WAMITInputsMod** = 0 forces all WAMIT reference point (WRP)
input motions to zero for all time. If you set **WAMITInputsMod** = 1,
then you must set the steady-state inputs in the WAMIT STEADY STATE
INPUTS section of the file. Setting **WAMITInputsMod** = 2, requires the
time-series input file whose name is specified via the
**WAMITInputsFile** parameter. The WAMIT inputs file is a text-formatted
file. This file has no header lines. Each data row corresponds to a
given time step, and the whitespace separated columns of floating point
values represent the necessary motion inputs as shown in
:numref:`hd-wamit_input_table`. All motions are specified in the global
inertial-frame coordinate system.

In a similar fashion, the input motions for the Morison members
(strip-theory model) are set to zero if **MorisonInputsMod** = 0. If you
select **MorsionInputsMod** = 1 then the motions at each substructure
joint are set to the steady-state values given in the MORISON STEADY
STATE INPUTS section. Currently, option 2 is unavailable for the Morison
inputs.

The standalone HydroDyn does not check for physical consistency between
motions specified for the WRP and Morison members in the driver file.

Setting **WaveElevSeriesFlag** to TRUE enables the outputting of a grid
of wave elevations to a text-based file with the name
``OutRootName.WaveElev.out``. The grid consists of **WaveElevNX** by
**WaveElevNY** wave elevations (centered at *X* = 0, *Y* = 0 i.e.,
(0,0)) with a **dX** and **dY** spacing in the global inertial-frame
coordinate system. These wave elevations are distinct and output
separately from the wave elevations determined by **NWaveElev** in the
HydroDyn primary input file, such that the total number of wave
elevation outputs is **NWaveElev** + ( **WaveElevNX** × **WaveElevNY**
). The wave-elevation output file ``OutRootName.WaveElev.out``
contains the total wave elevation, which is the sum of the first- and
second-order terms (when the second-order wave kinematics are optionally
enabled).

.. _hd-primary-input:

HydroDyn Primary Input File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The HydroDyn input file defines the substructure geometry, hydrodynamic
coefficients, incident wave kinematics and current, potential-flow
solution options, flooding/ballasting and marine growth, and auxiliary
parameters. The geometry of strip-theory members is defined by joint
coordinates of the undisplaced substructure in the global reference
system, with the origin at the intersection of the undeflected tower
centerline with MSL. A member connects two joints; multiple members can
use a common joint. The hydrodynamic loads are computed at nodes, which
are the resultant of member refinement into multiple (**MDivSize**
input) elements (nodes are located at the ends of each element), and
they are calculated by the module. Member properties include outer
diameter, thickness, and dynamic-pressure, added-mass and viscous-drag
coefficients. Member properties are specified at the joints; if
properties change from one joint to the other, they will be linearly
interpolated for the inner nodes.

The file is organized into several functional sections. Each section
corresponds to an aspect of the hydrodynamics model or the submerged
substructure. A sample HydroDyn primary input file is given in
:ref:`hd-primary-input_example`.

If this manual refers to an ID in a table entry, this is an integer
identifier for the table entry, and these IDs do not need to be
consecutive or increasing, but they must be unique for a given table
entry.

The input file begins with two lines of header information which is for
your use, but is not used by the software. On the next line, set the
**Echo** flag to TRUE if you wish to have HydroDyn echo the contents of
the HydroDyn input file (useful for debugging errors in the input file).
The echo file has the naming convention of **OutRootName**\ *.HD.ech*.
**OutRootName** is either specified in the HYDRODYN section of the
driver input file when running HydroDyn standalone, or by FAST when
running a coupled simulation.


Floating Platform
-----------------

This and the next few sections of the input file have "Floating
Platform" in the title, but the input parameters control the
potential-flow model, regardless of whether the substructure is floating
or not. The potential-flow solution cannot be used in conjunction with
nonzero **MSL2SWL** or **WaveMod** = 6.

If the load contributions from potential-flow theory are to be used, set
**PotMod** to 1 for the use of frequency-to-time-domain transforms based
on WAMIT output or 2 for the use of FIT (FIT is not yet documented in
this manual). With **PotMod** = 1, include the root name (without
extensions) for the WAMIT-related output files in **PotFile**. These
files consist of the *.1*, *.3*,\ *.hst* and second-order files. These
are written by the WAMIT program and should not include any file
headers. When the linear state-space model is used in placed of
convolution, the *.ss* file generated by
`SS_Fitting <https://nwtc.nrel.gov/SS_Fitting>`__ must have the same
root name as the other WAMIT-related files (see **RdtnMod** below). The
remaining parameters in this section are only used when **PotMod** = 1.

The output files from WAMIT are in a standard nondimensional form that
HydroDyn will dimensionalize internally upon input. **WAMITULEN** is the
characteristic body length scale used to redimensionalize the WAMIT
output. The body motions and forces in these files are in relation to
the WAMIT reference point (WRP) in HydroDyn, which for the undisplaced
substructure is the same as the origin of the global inertial-frame
coordinate system (0,0,0). The *.hst* file contains the 6x6 linear
hydrostatic restoring (stiffness) matrix of the platform. The *.1* file
contains the 6x6 frequency-dependent hydrodynamic added-mass and damping
matrix of the platform from the radiation problem. The *.3* file
contains the 6x1 frequency- and direction-dependent first-order
wave-excitation force vector of the platform from the linear diffraction
problem. While HydroDyn expects hydrodynamic coefficients derived from
WAMIT, if you are not using WAMIT, it is recommended that you reformat
your data according to the WAMIT format (including
nondimensionalization) before inputting them to HydroDyn. Information on
the WAMIT format is available from Chapter 4 of the WAMIT User's Guide
:cite:`LeeNewman:2006`.

**PtfmVol0** is the displaced volume of water when the platform is in
its undisplaced position. This value should be set equal to the value
computed by WAMIT as output in the WAMIT ``.out`` file. **PtfmCOBxt** and
**PtfmCOByt** are the *X* and *Y* offsets of the center of buoyancy from
the WRP.

HydroDyn has two methods for calculating the radiation memory effect.
Set **RdtnMod** to 1 for the convolution method, 2 for the linear
state-space model, or 0 to disable the memory effect calculation. For
the convolution method, **RdtnTMax** determines how long to track the
memory effect (truncating the convolutions at *t* – **RdtnTMax**, where
*t* is the current simulation time), but it also determines the
frequency step used in the cosine transform, from which the time-domain
radiation kernel (radiation impulse-response function) is derived. A
**RdtnTMax** of 60 s is usually more than sufficient because the
radiation kernel decays to zero after a short amount of time; setting
**RdtnTMax** much greater than this will cause HydroDyn to run
significantly slower. (**RdtnTMax** does not need to match or exceed the
total simulation length.) Setting **RdtnTMax** to 0 s disables the
memory effect, akin to setting **RdtnMod** to 0. For the convolution
method, **RdtnDT** is the time step for the radiation calculations
(numerical convolutions), but also determines the maximum frequency in
the cosine transform. For the state-space model, **RdtnDT** is the time
step to use for time integration of the linear state-space model. In
this version of HydroDyn, **RdtnDT** must match the glue code
(FAST/driver program) simulation time step; the DEFAULT keyword can be
used for this.

.. _hd-2nd_order_floating_platform_forces_input:

2\ :sup:`nd`-Order Floating Platform Forces
-------------------------------------------
The 2\ :sup:`ND`-ORDER FLOATING PLATFORM FORCES section of the input
file allows the option of adding second-order contributions to the
potential-flow solution. When second-order terms are optionally enabled,
the second-order terms are calculated using the first-order
wave-component amplitudes and extra energy is added to the wave spectrum
(at the difference and sum frequencies). The second-order terms cannot
be computed without also including the first-order terms from the
FLOATING PLATFORM section above (**PotMod** = 1). Enabling the
second-order terms allows one to capture some of the nonlinearities of
real surface waves, permitting more accurate modeling of sea states and
the associated wave loads at the expense of greater computational effort
(mostly at HydroDyn initialization).

While the cut-off frequencies in the :ref:`sea-2nd_order_waves_input` section
of the SeaState module to apply to both the second-order wave kinematics used by strip
theory and the second-order diffraction loads in potential-flow theory,
the second-order terms themselves are enabled separately. The
second-order wave kinematics used by strip theory are enabled in the
:ref:`sea-2nd_order_waves_input` section while the second-order
diffraction loads in potential-flow theory are enabled in this section.
While the second-order effects are included when enabled, the wave
elevations output from HydroDyn will only include the second-order terms
when the second-order wave kinematics are enabled in the
:ref:`sea-2nd_order_waves_input` section in the SeaState module documetation.

The second-order difference-frequency potential-flow terms can be
enabled in one of three ways. To compute only the mean-drift term, set
**MnDrift** to a nonzero value; to estimate the mean- and slow-drift
terms using Standing et al.’s extension to Newman’s approximation, based
only on first-order effects, set **NewmanApp** to a nonzero value; or to
compute the mean- and slow-drift terms using the full
difference-frequency QTF set **DiffQTF** to a nonzero value. Valid
values of **MnDrift** are 0, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 corresponding to
which WAMIT output file the mean-drift terms will be calculated from.
Valid values of **NewmanApp** are 0, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12
corresponding to which WAMIT output file the Newman’s approximation will
be calculated from. Newman’s approximation cannot be used in conjunction
with directional spreading (**WaveDirMod** must be 0) and the
second-order cut-off frequencies do not apply to Newman’s approximation.
Valid values of **DiffQTF** are 0, 10, 11, or 12 corresponding to which
WAMIT output file the full difference-frequency potential-flow solution
will be calculated from. Only one of **MnDrift**, **NewmanApp**, and
**DiffQTF** can be nonzero; a setting of 0 disregards the second-order
difference-frequency contributions to the potential-flow solution.

The .\ *7* WAMIT file refers to the mean-drift loads (diagonal of the
difference-frequency QTF) in all 6 DOFs derived from the control-surface
integration method based on the first-order solution. The .\ *8* WAMIT
file refers to the mean-drift loads (diagonal of the
difference-frequency QTF) only in surge, sway, and roll derived from the
momentum conservation principle based on the first-order solution. The
.\ *9* WAMIT file refers to the mean-drift loads (diagonal of the
difference-frequency QTF) in all six DOFs derived from the pressure
integration method based on the first-order solution. For the
difference-frequency terms, 10, 11, and 12 refer to the WAMIT .\ *10d*,
.\ *11d*, and .\ *12d* files, corresponding to the full QTF of (.*10d*)
loads in all 6 DOFs associated with the quadratic interaction of
first-order quantities, (.*11d*) total (quadratic plus second-order
potential) loads in all 6 DOFs derived by the indirect method, and
(.*12d*) total (quadratic plus second-order potential) loads in all 6
DOFs derived by the direct method, respectively.

The second-order sum-frequency potential-flow terms can only be enabled
using the full sum-frequency QTF, by setting **SumQTF** to a nonzero
value. Valid values of **SumQTF** are 0, 10, 11, or 12 corresponding to
which WAMIT output file the full sum-frequency potential-flow solution
will be calculated from; a setting of 0 disregards the second-order
sum-frequency contributions to the potential-flow solution. For the
sum-frequency terms, 10, 11, and 12 refer to the WAMIT .\ *10s*,
.\ *11s*, and .\ *12s* files, corresponding to the full QTF of (.*10s*)
loads in all 6 DOFs associated with the quadratic interaction of
first-order quantities, (.*11s*) total (quadratic plus second-order
potential) loads in all 6 DOFs derived by the indirect method, and
(.*12s*) total (quadratic plus second-order potential) loads in all 6
DOFs derived by the direct method, respectively.

Platform Additional Stiffness and Damping
-----------------------------------------
The vectors and matrices of this section are used to generate additional
loads on the platform (in addition to other hydrodynamic terms
calculated by HydroDyn), per the following equation.

.. math::
  :label: PtfmStiffDamp

  \overrightarrow{F}_{Add} = \overrightarrow{F}_{0} - [C] \overrightarrow{q} - [B] \dot{\overrightarrow{q}} - [B_{quad}] ABS \left(\dot{\overrightarrow{q}}\right) \dot{\overrightarrow{q}}

where :math:`\overrightarrow{F}_{0}` corresponds to the **AddF0** 6x1 static load (preload) vector,
:math:`[C]` corresponds to the **AddCLin** 6x6
linear restoring (stiffness) matrix,
:math:`[B]` corresponds to the **AddBLin** 6x6
linear damping matrix, :math:`[B_{quad}]`
corresponds to the **AddBQuad** 6x6 quadratic drag matrix, and :math:`\overrightarrow{q}`
corresponds to the WRP 6x1 (six-DOF) displacement vector (three
translations and three rotations), where the overdot refers to the first
time-derivative.

These terms can be used, e.g., to model a linearized mooring system, to
augment strip-theory members with a linear hydrostatic restoring matrix
(see :numref:`hd-modeling-hydrostatic-restoring-strip-theory`), or to "tune" HydroDyn to match damping to
experimental results, such as free-decay tests. While likely most useful
for floating systems, these matrices can also be used for fixed-bottom
systems; in both cases, the resulting load is applied at the WRP, which
when HydroDyn is coupled to FAST, get applied to the platform in
ElastoDyn (bypassing SubDyn for fixed-bottom systems). See :ref:`hd-modeling-considerations`
for addition guidance for where these terms are necessary.

Axial Coefficients
------------------
This and the next several sections of the input file control the
strip-theory model for both fixed-bottom and floating substructures.

HydroDyn computes lumped viscous-drag, added-mass, fluid-inertia, and
static pressure loads at member ends (joints). The hydrodynamic
coefficients for the lumped the lumped loads at joints are referred to
as "axial coefficients" and include viscous-drag coefficients, **AxCd**,
added-mass coefficients, **AxCa**, and dynamic-pressure coefficients,
**AxCp**. **AxCa** influences both the added-mass loads and the
scattering component of the fluid-inertia loads. Any number of separate
axial coefficient sets, distinguished by **AxCoefID**, may be specified
by setting **NAxCoef** > 1.

Axial viscous-drag loads will be calculated for all specified member
joints. Axial added-mass, fluid-inertia, and static-pressure loads will
only be calculated for member joints of members not modeled with
potential flow (**PropPot** = FALSE). Axial loads are only calculated at
user-specified joints. Axial loads are not calculated at joints HydroDyn
may automatically create as part its solution process. For example, if
you want axial effects at a marine-growth boundary (where HydroDyn
automatically adds a joint), you must explicitly set a joint at that
location.

Member Joints
-------------
The strip-theory model is based on a substructure composed of joints
interconnected by members. **NJoints** is the user-specified number of
joints and determines the number of rows in the subsequent table.
Because a member connects two nodes, **NJoints** must be exactly zero or
greater than or equal to two. Each joint listed in the table is
identified by a unique integer, **JointID**. The (*X*,\ *Y*,\ *Z*)
coordinate of each joint is specified in the global inertial-frame
coordinate system via **Jointxi**, **Jointyi**, and **Jointzi**,
respectively. **JointAxID** corresponds to an entry in the AXIAL
COEFFICIENTS table and sets the axial coefficients for a joint. This
version of HydroDyn cannot calculate joint overlap when multiple members
meet at a common joint; therefore **JointOvrlp** must be set to 0.
Future releases will enable joint overlap calculations.

Modeling a fixed-bottom substructure embedded into the seabed (e.g.,
through piles or suction buckets) requires that the lowest member
joint(s) lie below the water depth. Placing a joint at or above the
water depth results in static pressure loads being applied.

Member Cross-Sections
---------------------
Members in HydroDyn are assumed to be straight circular (and possibly
tapered) cylinders. Apart from the hydrodynamic coefficients, the
circular cross-section properties needed for the hydrodynamic load
calculations are member outer diameter, **PropD**, and member thickness,
**PropThck**. You will need to create an entry in this table,
distinguished by **PropSetID**, for each unique combination of these two
properties. The member property-set table contains **NPropSets** rows.
The member property sets are referred to by their **PropSetID** in the
MEMBERS table, as described in :numref:`hd-members` below. **PropD**
determines the static buoyancy loads exterior to a member, as well as
the area used in the viscous-drag calculation and the volume used in the
added-mass and fluid-inertia calculations. **PropThck** determines the
interior volume for fluid-filled (flooded/ballasted) members.

Hydrodynamic Coefficients
-------------------------
HydroDyn computes distributed viscous-drag, added-mass, fluid-inertia,
and static buoyancy loads along members.

The hydrodynamic coefficients for the distributed strip-theory loads are
specified using any of three models, which we refer to as the simple
model, a depth-based model, and a member-based model. All of these
models require the specification of both transverse and axial
hydrodynamic coefficients for viscous drag, added mass, and dynamic
pressure (axial viscous drag is not yet available). The added-mass
coefficient influences both the added-mass loads and the scattering
component of the fluid-inertia loads. There are separate set of
hydrodynamic coefficients both with and without marine growth. A given
element will either use the marine growth or the standard version of a
coefficient, but never both. Note that input members are split into
elements, one of the splitting rules guarantees the
previous statement is true. Which members have marine growth is defined
by the MARINE GROWTH table of :numref:`hd-marine-growth`. You can specify only one
model type, **MCoefMod**, for any given member in the MEMBERS table.
However, different members can specify different coefficient models.

.. elements per Section 7.5.2, one of the splitting rules guarantees the
.. TODO 7.5.2 is the theory section which does not yet exist.

In the hydrodynamic coefficient input parameters, **Cd**, **Ca**, and
**Cp** refer to the viscous-drag, added-mass, and dynamic-pressure
coefficients, respectively, **MG** identifies the coefficients to be
applied for members with marine growth (the standard values are
identified without **MG**), and **Ax** identifies the axial coefficients
to be applied for tapered members (the transverse coefficients are
identified without **Ax**). It is noted that for the transverse
coefficients, , the inertia coefficient.

While the strip-theory solution assumes circular cross sections, the
hydrodynamic coefficients can include shape corrections; however, there
is no distinction made in HydroDyn between different transverse
directions.

Simple Model
++++++++++++
This table consists of a single complete set of hydrodynamic
coefficients as follows: **SimplCd**, **SimplCdMG**, **SimplCa**,
**SimplCaMG**, **SimplCp**, **SimplCpMG**, **SimplAxCa**,
**SimplAxCaMG**, **SimplAxCp**, and **SimplAxCpMG**. These hydrodynamic
coefficients are referenced in the members table of :numref:`hd-members` by
selecting **MCoefMod** = 1.

Depth-Based Model
+++++++++++++++++
The depth-based coefficient model allows you to specify a series of
depth-dependent coefficients. **NCoefDpth** is the user-specified number
of depths and determines the number of rows in the subsequent table.
Currently, this table requires that the rows are ordered by increasing
depth, **Dpth**; this is equivalent to a decreasing global
*Z*-coordinate. The hydrodynamic coefficients at each depth are as
follows: **DpthCd**, **DpthCdMG**, **DpthCa**, **DpthCaMG**, **DpthCp**,
**DpthCpMG**, **DpthAxCa**, **DpthAxCaMG**, **DpthAxCp**, and
**DpthAxCpMG**. Members use these hydrodynamic coefficients by setting
**MCoefMod** = 2. The HydroDyn module will interpolate coefficients for
a node whose *Z*-coordinate lies between table *Z*-coordinates.

Member-Based Model
++++++++++++++++++
The member-based coefficient model allows you to specify a hydrodynamic
coefficients for each particular member. **NCoefMembers** is the
user-specified number of members with member-based coefficients and
determines the number of rows in the subsequent table. The hydrodynamic
coefficients for a member distinguished by **MemberID** are as follows:
**MemberCd1**, **MemberCd2**, **MemberCdMG1**, **MemberCdMG2**,
**MemberCa1**, **MemberCa2**, **MemberCaMG1**, **MemberCaMG2**,
**MemberCp1**, **MemberCp2**, **MemberCpMG1**, **MemberCpMG2**,
**MemberAxCa1**, **MemberAxCa2**, **MemberAxCaMG1**, **MemberAxCaMG2**,
**MemberAxCp1**, **MemberAxCp2**, **MemberAxCpMG1**, and
**MemberAxCpMG2**, where *1* and *2* identify the starting and ending
joint of the member, respectively. Members use these hydrodynamic
coefficients by setting **MCoefMod** = 3.

.. _hd-members:

Members
-------

**NMembers** is the user-specified number of members and determines the
number of rows in the subsequent table. For each member distinguished by
**MemberID**, **MJointID1** specifies the starting joint and
**MJointID2** specifies the ending joint, corresponding to an identifier
(**JointID**) from the MEMBER JOINTS table. Likewise, **MPropSetID1**
corresponds to the starting cross-section properties and **MProSetID2**
specify the ending cross-section properties, allowing for tapered
members. **MDivSize** determines the maximum spacing (in meters) between
simulation nodes where the distributed loads are actually computed; the
smaller the number, the finer the resolution and longer the
computational time.
Each member in your model will have hydrodynamic coefficients, which are
specified using one of the three models (**MCoefMod**). Model 1 uses a
single set of coefficients found in the SIMPLE HYDRODYNAMIC COEFFICIENTS
section. Model 2 is depth-based, and is determined via the table found
in the DEPTH-BASED HYDRODYNAMIC COEFFICIENTS section. Model 3 specifies
coefficients for a particular member, by referring to the MEMBER-BASED
HYDRODYNAMIC COEFFICIENTS section. The **PropPot** flag indicates
whether the corresponding member coincides with the body represented by
the potential-flow solution. When **PropPot** = TRUE, only viscous-drag
loads, and ballasting loads will be computed for that member.

.. TODO 7.5.2 is the theory section which does not yet exist.
.. Section 7.5.2 discusses the difference between the user-supplied discretization and the simulation discretization.

Filled Members
--------------
Members—whether they are also modeled with potential-flow or not—may be
fluid-filled, meaning that they are flooded and/or ballasted.
Fluid-filled members introduce interior buoyancy that subtracts from the
exterior buoyancy and a mass. Both distributed loads along a member and
lumped loads at joints are applied. The volume of fluid in the member is
derived from the outer diameter and thickness of the member and a
fluid-filled free-surface level. The fluid in the member is assumed to
be compartmentalized such that it does not slosh. Rotational inertia of
the fluid in the member is ignored. A member’s filled configuration is
defined by the filled-fluid density and the free-surface level. Filled
members that have the same configuration are collected into fill groups.

**NFillGroups** specifies the number of fluid-filled member groups and
determines the number of rows in the subsequent table. **FillNumM**
specifies the number of members in the fill group. **FillMList** is a
list of **FillNumM** whitespace-separated **MemberID**\ s. **FillFSLoc**
specifies the *Z*-height of the free-surface (0 for MSL). **FillDens**
is the density of the fluid. If **FillDens** = DEFAULT, then
**FillDens** = **WtrDens**.

.. _hd-marine-growth:

Marine Growth
-------------
Members not also modeled with potential-flow theory may be modeled with
marine growth. Marine growth causes three effects. First, marine growth
introduces a static weight and mass to a member, applied as distributed
loads along the member. Second, marine growth increases the outer
diameter of a member, which impacts the diameter used in the
viscous-drag, added-mass, fluid-inertia, and static buoyancy load
calculations. Third, the hydrodynamic coefficients for viscous drag,
added mass, and dynamic pressure are specified distinctly for marine
growth. Rotational inertia of the marine growth is ignored and marine
growth is not added to member ends.

Marine growth is specified using a depth-based table with **NMGDepths**
rows. This table must have exactly zero or at least 2 rows. The columns
in the table include the local depth, **MGDpth**, the marine growth
thickness, **MGThck**, and marine growth density, **MGDens**. Marine
growth for a particular location in the substructure geometry is added
by linearly interpolating between the marine-growth table entries. The
smallest and largest values of **MGDpth** define the marine growth
region. Outside this region the marine growth thickness is set to zero.
If you want sub-regions of zero marine growth thickness within these
bounds, you must generate depth entries which explicitly set **MGThck**
to zero. The hydrodynamic coefficient tables contain coefficients with
and without marine growth. If **MGThck** = 0 for a particular node, the
coefficients not associated with marine growth are used.

.. _hd-member-output-list:

Member Output List
------------------
HydroDyn can output distributed load and wave kinematic quantities at up
to 9 locations on up to 9 different members, for a total of 81 possible
local member output locations. **NMOutputs** specifies the number of
members. You must create a table entry for each requested member. Within
a table entry, **MemberID** is the ID specified in the MEMBERS table,
and **NOutLoc** specifies how many output locations are generated for
this member. **NodeLocs** specifies those locations as a normalized
distance from the starting joint (0.0) to the ending joint (1.0) of the
member. If the chosen location does not align with a calculation node,
the results at the two surrounding nodes will be linearly interpolated.
The outputs specified in :ref:`hd-output-channels` determines which
quantities are actually output at these locations.

.. _hd-joint-output-list:

Joint Output List
-----------------
HydroDyn can output lumped load and wave kinematic quantities at up to 9
different joints. **JOutLst** contains a list of **NJOutputs** number of
**JointIDs**. The outputs specified in :ref:`hd-output-channels`
determines which quantities are actually output at these joints.

Output
------
Specifying **HDSum** = TRUE causes HydroDyn to generate a summary file
with name **OutRootname**\ *.HD.sum*. **OutRootName** is either
specified in the HYDRODYN section of the driver input file when running
HydroDyn standalone, or by the FAST program when running a coupled
simulation. See :numref:`hd-summary-file` for summary file details.

For this version, **OutAll** must be set to FALSE. In future versions,
setting **OutAll** = TRUE will cause HydroDyn to auto-generate outputs
for every joint and member in the input file.

If **OutSwtch** is set to 1, outputs are sent to a file with the name
``OutRootname.HD.out``. If **OutSwtch** is set to 2, outputs are
sent to the calling program (FAST) for writing. If **OutSwtch** is set
to 3, both file outputs occur. In standalone mode, setting **OutSwitch**
to 2 results in no output file being produced.

The **OutFmt** and **OutSFmt** parameters control the formatting for the
output data and the channel headers, respectively. HydroDyn currently
does not check the validity of these format strings. They need to be
valid Fortran format strings. Since the **OutSFmt** is used for the
column header and **OutFmt** is for the channel data, in order for the
headers and channel data to align properly, the width specification
should match. For example,

.. code-block:: fortran

      "ES11.4" OutFmt
      "A11" OutSFmt

Output Channels
---------------
This section controls output quantities generated by HydroDyn. Enter one
or more lines containing quoted strings that in turn contain one or more
output parameter names. Separate output parameter names by any
combination of commas, semicolons, spaces, and/or tabs. If you prefix a
parameter name with a minus sign, "-", underscore, "_", or the
characters "m" or "M", HydroDyn will multiply the value for that channel
by –1 before writing the data. The parameters are not necessarily
written in the order they are listed in the input file. HydroDyn allows
you to use multiple lines so that you can break your list into
meaningful groups and so the lines can be shorter. You may enter
comments after the closing quote on any of the lines. Entering a line
with the string "END" at the beginning of the line or at the beginning
of a quoted string found at the beginning of the line will cause
HydroDyn to quit scanning for more lines of channel names. Member- and
joint-related quantities are generated for the requested 
:ref:`hd-member-output-list` and :ref:`hd-joint-output-list`.
If HydroDyn encounters an unknown/invalid
channel name, it warns the users but will remove the suspect channel
from the output file. Please refer to Appendix C for a complete list of
possible output parameters.
