Future Work
===========

The following list contains future work on BeamDyn software:

-  Eliminating numerical problems in single precision.

-  Implementing eigenvalue analysis.

-  Improving input options for stand-alone version to make it more
   user-friendly.

-  Implementing GEBT based on modal method for computational efficiency.

-  Adding more options for blade cross-sectional properties inputs. For
   example, for general isotropic beams, engineering parameters
   including sectional offsets, material properties, etc will be used to
   generate the 6 :math:`\times` 6 matrices needed by BeamDyn.

-  Writing a general guidance on modeling composite beam structures
   using BeamDyn, , for example, how to select a time step, how to
   select the model discretization, how to define the blade reference
   axis, where to get 6x6 mass/stiffness matrices, etc.

-  Extending applications in FAST to other slender structures in the
   wind turbine system, for example, tower, mooring lines, and shaft.

-  Developing a simplified form of GEBT with only rotational DOFs
   (bending, torsion) for computational efficiency.
