SubDyn Theory
==============


Overview
------------------

This section focuses on the theory behind the SubDyn module.

SubDyn relies on two main engineering approaches: (1) a linear frame
finite-element beam model (LFEB), and (2) a dynamics system reduction
via the Craig-Bampton (C-B) method together with a static-improvement
method (SIM), greatly reducing the number of modes needed to obtain an
accurate solution.

There are many nonlinearities present in offshore wind substructure
models, including material nonlinearity, axial shortening caused by
bending, large displacements, and so on. The material nonlinearity is
not considered here because most offshore multimember support structures
are designed to use steel and the maximum stress is intended to be below
the yield strength of the material. :cite:`damiani2013omae` demonstrate
that a linear finite-element method is suitable when analyzing wind
turbine substructures. In this work, several wind turbine configurations
that varied in base geometry, load paths, sizes, supported towers, and
turbine masses were analyzed under extreme loads using nonlinear and
linear models. The results revealed that the nonlinear behavior was
mainly caused by the mono-tower response and had little effect on the
multimember support structures. Therefore, an LFEB model for the
substructure is considered appropriate for wind turbine substructures.
The LFEB can accommodate different element types, including
Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam elements of either constant or
longitudinally tapered cross sections (Timoshenko beam elements account
for shear deformation and are better suited to represent low aspect
ratio beams that may be used within frames and to transfer the loads
within the frame).

The large number of DOFs (~ :math:`{10^3}`) associated with a standard
finite-element analysis of a typical multimember structure would hamper
computational efficiency during wind turbine system dynamic simulations.
As a result, the C-B system reduction was implemented to speed up
processing time while retaining a high level of fidelity in the overall
system response. The C-B reduction is used to recharacterize the
substructure finite-element model into a reduced DOF model that
maintains the fundamental low-frequency response modes of the structure.
In the SubDyn initialization step, the large substructure physical DOFs
(displacements) are reduced to a small number of modal DOFs and
interface (boundary) DOFs, and during each time step, only the equations
of motion of these DOFs need to be solved. SubDyn only solves the
equations of motion for the modal DOFs, the motion of the interface
(boundary) DOFs are either prescribed when running SubDyn in stand-alone
mode or solved through equations of motion in ElastoDyn when SubDyn is
coupled to FAST.

Retaining just a few DOFs may, however, lead to the exclusion of axial
modes (normally of very high frequencies), which are important to
capture static load effects, such as those caused by gravity and
buoyancy. The so-called SIM was implemented to mitigate this problem.
SIM computes two static solutions at each time step: one based on the
full system stiffness matrix and one based on the C-B reduced stiffness
matrix. At each time step the time-varying, C-B based, dynamic solution
is superimposed on the difference between the two static solutions,
which amounts to quasi-statically accounting for the contribution of
those modes not directly included within the dynamic solution.

In SubDyn, the substructure is considered to be clamped, or connected
via linear spring-like elements, at the bottom nodes (normally at the
seabed) and rigidly connected to the TP at the substructure top nodes
(interface nodes). The user can provide 6x6, equivalent stiffness and
mass matrices for each of the bottom nodes to account for soil-pile
interaction. As described in other sections of this document, the input
file defines the substructure geometry, material properties, and
constraints. Users can define: element types; full finite-element mode
or C-B reduction; the number of modes to be retained in the C-B
reduction; modal damping coefficients; whether to take advantage of SIM;
and the number of elements for each member.

The following sections discuss the integration of SubDyn within the FAST
framework, the main coordinate systems used in the module, and the
theory pertaining to the LFEB, the C-B reduction, and SIM. The
state-space formulations to be used in the time-domain simulation are
also presented. The last section discusses the calculation of the base
reaction calculation. For further details, see also :cite:`song2013`.

Integration with the FAST Modularization Framework
--------------------------------------------------

Based on a new modularization framework :cite:`jjonkman2013`, FAST joins an
aerodynamics module, a hydrodynamics module, a control and electrical
system (servo) module, and structural-dynamics (elastic) modules to
enable coupled nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic analysis of land-based
and offshore wind turbines in the time domain.  :numref:`flow-chart2` shows the basic
layout of the SubDyn module within the FAST modularization framework.

In the existing loosely coupled time-integration scheme, the glue-code
transfers data at each time step. Such data includes hydrodynamic loads,
substructure response, loads transmitted to the TP, and TP response
among SubDyn, HydroDyn, and ElastoDyn. At the interface nodes, the TP
displacement, rotation, velocity, and acceleration are inputs to SubDyn
from ElastoDyn, and the reaction forces at the TP are outputs of SubDyn
for input to ElastoDyn. SubDyn also outputs the substructure
displacements, velocities, and accelerations for input to HydroDyn to
calculate the hydrodynamic loads that become inputs for SubDyn. In
addition, SubDyn can calculate the member forces, as requested by the
user. Within this scheme, SubDyn tracks its states and integrates its
equations through its own solver.

In a tightly coupled time-integration scheme (yet to be implemented),
SubDyn sets up its own equations, but its states and those of other
modules are tracked and integrated by a solver within the glue-code that
is common to all of the modules.

SubDyn is implemented in a state-space formulation that forms the
equation of motion of the substructure system with physical DOFs at the
boundaries and modal DOFs representing all interior motions. At each
time step, loads and motions are exchanged between modules through the
driver code; the modal responses are calculated inside SubDyn’s
state-space model; and the next time-step responses are calculated by
the SubDyn integrator for loose coupling and the global system
integrator for tight coupling.

Coordinate Systems

   Global (coincident with the substructure) coordinate system.
   Also shown are the DOFs associated with the TP reference point.

Global and Substructure Coordinate System: (*X*, *Y*, *Z*) or (:math:`{X_{SS}, Y_{SS}, Z_{SS}}`) (:numref:`global-cs`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The global axes are represented by the unit vectors :math:`{\hat{I}, \hat{J}}`, and :math:`{\hat{K}}`.

-  The origin is set at the intersection between the undeflected tower
   centerline and the horizontal plane identified by the mean sea level
   (MSL) for offshore systems or ground level for land-based systems.

-  The positive *Z* (:math:`{Z_{SS}}`) axis is vertical and pointing upward, opposite
   gravity.

-  The positive *X* (:math:`{X_{SS}}`) axis is along the nominal (zero-degree)
   wind and wave propagation direction.

-  The *Y* (:math:`{Y_{SS}}`) axis is transverse and can be found assuming a
   right-handed Cartesian coordinate system (directed to the left when
   looking in the nominal downwind direction).

Member or Element Local Coordinate System (:math:`{x_e, y_e, z_e}`) (:numref:`element-cs`) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Axes are represented by the unit vectors :math:`{\hat{i}_e, \hat{j}_e, \hat{k}_e}`.

-  The origin is set at the shear center of the cross section at the
   start node (S,MJointID1).

-  The local  :math:`z_{e}` axis is along the elastic axis of the member, directed from
   the start node (S) to the end node (E,MJointID2). Nodes are ordered
   along the member main axis directed from start joint to end joint
   (per user's input definition).

-  The local  :math:`x_{e}` axis is parallel to the global :math:`\text{XY}` plane, and
   directed such that a positive, less than or equal to 180 :math:`^\circ` rotation
   about it, would bring the local :math:`z_{e}` axis parallel to the global *Z* axis.

-  The local :math:`y_{e}` axis can be found assuming a right-handed Cartesian
   coordinate system.

Local to Global Transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The transformation from local to global coordinate system can be
expressed by the following equation:

   .. math:: 	:label: loc2glb
   
      \begin{bmatrix} \Delta X \\ \Delta Y \\ \Delta Z \end{bmatrix}  =  [ \mathbf{D_c} ]  \begin{bmatrix} \Delta x_e \\ \Delta y_e \\ \Delta z_e \end{bmatrix} 
	
where :math:`\begin{bmatrix} \Delta x_e \\ \Delta y_e \\ \Delta z_e \end{bmatrix}` is a generic vector in the local coordinate system, and 
:math:`\begin{bmatrix} \Delta X \\ \Delta Y \\ \Delta Z \end{bmatrix}` the same
vector but in the global coordinate system; and :math:`[ \mathbf{D_c} ]` is the direction cosine
matrix of the member axes and can be obtained as follows:
   
   .. math:: 	:label: Dc
   
      [ \mathbf{D_c} ] = \begin{bmatrix}  
                         \frac{Y_E-Y_S}{L_{exy}}  & \frac{ \left ( X_E-X_S \right) \left ( Z_E-Z_S \right)}{L_{exy} L_{e}} & \frac{X_E-X_S}{L_{e}} \\
                         \frac{-X_E+X_S}{L_{exy}} & \frac{ \left ( Y_E-Y_S \right) \left ( Z_E-Z_S \right)}{L_{exy} L_{e}} & \frac{Y_E-Y_S}{L_{e}} \\
                         0                        & \frac{ -L_{exy} }{L_{e}} & \frac{Z_E-Z_S}{L_{e}} 
                         \end{bmatrix}
                         
Where :math:`{\left ( X_s,Y_s,Z_s \right )}` and :math:`{\left ( X_E,Y_E,Z_E \right )}`
are the start and end joints of the member (or nodes of the element of interest) in global coordinate system ; 
:math:`{L_{exy}= \sqrt{ \left ( X_E-X_S \right )^2 + \left ( Y_E-Y_S \right )^2}}` and :math:`{L_{e}= \sqrt{ \left ( X_E-X_S \right )^2 + \left ( Y_E-Y_S \right )^2 + \left ( Z_E-Z_S \right )^2}}`.

If :math:`{X_E = X_S}` and :math:`{Z_E = Z_S}`, the :math:`{[ \mathbf{D_c} ]}` matrix can be found as follows:

if :math:`{Z_E < Z_S}` then

 .. math:: 	:label: Dc_spec1
   
      [ \mathbf{D_c} ] = \begin{bmatrix}  
                         1  & 0 & 0 \\
                         0  & 1 & 0 \\
                         0  & 0 & 1
                         \end{bmatrix}

else

 .. math:: 	:label: Dc_spec2
   
      [ \mathbf{D_c} ] = \begin{bmatrix}  
                         1  & 0  & 0 \\
                         0  & -1 & 0 \\
                         0  & 0  & -1
                         \end{bmatrix}

In the current SubDyn release, the transpose (global to local) of these
direction cosine matrices for each member is returned in the summary
file. Given the circular shape of the member cross sections, the
direction cosine matrices have little importance on the member load
verification. To verify joints following the standards (e.g., :cite:`iso19902` :cite:`api2014`
), however, the bending moments need to be decomposed into
in-plane and out-of-plane components, where the plane is that defined by
either a pair of braces (for an X-joint), or by the pair brace(s) plus
leg (for a K-joint). It is therefore important to have the direction
cosines of the interested members readily available to properly
manipulate and transform the local shear forces and bending moments.

When member cross sections other than circular are allowed in future
releases, the user will need to input cosine matrices to indicate the
final orientation of the member principal axes with respect to the
global reference frame.

Linear Finite-Element Beam Model
--------------------------------

In SubDyn, the LFEB can accommodate different two-node beam element
types, including Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam elements, either of
constant or tapered cross sections. The tapered element formulation has
been derived, but has not been implemented in the current SubDyn
release.

The uniform and tapered Euler-Bernoulli beam elements are
displacement-based and use third-order interpolation functions that
guarantee the displacement and rotation continuity between elements. The
uniform Timoshenko beam element is derived by introducing the shear
deformation into the uniform Euler-Bernoulli element, so the
displacements are represented by third-order interpolation functions as
well.

Element Formulation    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the classic Timoshenko beam theory, the generic two-node
element stiffness and consistent mass matrices can be written as follows
(see, for instance, :cite:`panzer2009`):

                 \end{array}\right]
                 
where :math:`A_z` is the element cross-section area, :math:`J_x, J_y, J_z` are the area second moments of
inertia with respect to principal axes of the cross section; :math:`L_e` is the
length of the undisplaced element from start-node to end-node; :math:`\rho, E, \textrm{and}\quad G` are material density, Young’s, and Shear moduli, respectively;
:math:`K_{sx}, K_{sy}` are shear correction factors as shown below (they are set to zero if
the E-B formulation is chosen):

.. math:: 	:label: Ksxy

	K_{sx}= \frac{12 E J_y}{G A_{sx} L_e^2} 
	
	K_{sy}= \frac{12 E J_x}{G A_{sy} L_e^2}
	
where the shear areas along the local *x* and *y* (principal) axes are
defined as:

.. math:: 	:label: Asxy

	A_{sx}= k_{ax} A_z
	
	A_{sy}= k_{ay} A_z



and

.. math:: 	:label: kaxy

   k_{ax} = k_{ay} = \dfrac{ 6 (1 + \mu)^2 \left(1 + \left( \frac{D_i}{D_o} \right)^2 \right)^2 } { \left(1+  \left( \frac{D_i}{D_o} \right)^2 \right)^2 (7 + 14 \mu + 8 \mu^2) + 4 \left( \frac{D_i}{D_o} \right)^2 (5+10 \mu +4 \mu^2)} 
   
   	

Eq. :eq:`kaxy` is from :cite:`steinboeck2013` for hollow circular cross sections,
with :math:`\mu` denoting Poisson’s ratio.

Before assembling the global system stiffness (*K*) and mass (*M*)
matrices, the individual :math:`{[k_e]}` and math:`{[m_e]}` are modified to the global coordinate
system via :math:`{[ \mathbf{D_c} ]}` as shown in the following equations:

.. math:: 	:label: ke1

	[k] =  \begin{bmatrix}     
                         [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                         & [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0 & 0  \\
                         & & [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0  \\
                         & & & [\mathbf{D_c}] 
                 \end{bmatrix}  [k_e] \begin{bmatrix}    
                         [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                         & [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0 & 0  \\
                         & & [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0  \\
                         & & & [\mathbf{D_c}] 
                 \end{bmatrix}^T  

.. math:: 	:label: me1

	[m] =  \begin{bmatrix}     
                         [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                         & [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0 & 0  \\
                         & & [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0  \\
                         & & & [\mathbf{D_c}] 
                 \end{bmatrix}  [m_e] \begin{bmatrix}    
                         [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                         & [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0 & 0  \\
                         & & [\mathbf{D_c}] & 0  \\
                         & & & [\mathbf{D_c}] 
                 \end{bmatrix}^T  

where *m* and *k* are element matrices in the global coordinate system.

Self-Weight Loads  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The loads caused by self-weight are precomputed during initialization
based on the undisplaced configuration. It is therefore assumed that the
displacements will be small and that P-delta effects are small for the
substructure. For a nontapered beam element, the lumped loads caused by
gravity to be applied at the end nodes are as follows (in the global
coordinate system):

.. math::  :label: FG

	\left\{ F_G \right\} = \rho A_z g 
                       \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\
                       0 \\
                       -\frac{L_e}{2} \\
		       -\frac{L_e^2}{12} D_{c2,3} \\
		        \frac{L_e^2}{12} D_{c1,3} \\
		       0\\
		       0\\
		       0\\
                       -\frac{L_e}{2}\\
		        \frac{L_e^2}{12} D_{c2,3}\\
		       -\frac{L_e^2}{12} D_{c1,3}\\
		       0
		     \end{bmatrix}

Note also that if lumped masses exist (selected by the user at
prescribed joints), their contribution will be included as concentrated
forces along global *Z* at the relevant nodes.

.. _CBreduction:

Dynamic System of Equations and C-B Reduction 
---------------------------------------------

The main equations of motion of SubDyn are written as follows:

.. math::  :label: main

         [M] \{ \ddot{U} \} +[C] \{ \dot{U} \} + [K] \{ U \} = \{ F \}
	

where :math:`{[M]}` and :math:`{[K]}` are the global mass and stiffness matrices of the substructure
beam frame, assembled from the element mass and stiffness matrices.
Additionally, :math:`{[M]}` and :math:`{[K]}` contain the contribution from any specified :math:`{[M_{SSI}]}` and :math:`{[K_{SSI}]}`  that
are directly added to the proper partially restrained node DOF rows and
column indexed elements.

:math:`{{U}}` and :math:`{{F}}` are the displacements and external forces along all of the DOFs of
the assembled system. The damping matrix :math:`{[C]}` is not assembled from the
element contributions, because those are normally unknown, but can be specified in different ways, as discussed in :numref:`SD_DampingSpecifications`.
A derivative with respect to time is represented by a dot, so that :math:`{\dot{U}}` and :math:`{\ddot{U}}` are
the first- and second-time derivatives of :math:`{{U}}`, respectively.

The number of DOFs associated with Eq. :eq:`main` can easily grow to the thousands
for typical beam frame substructures. That factor, combined with the
need for time-domain simulations of turbine dynamics, may seriously slow
down the computational efficiency of aeroelastic codes such as FAST
(note that a typical wind turbine system model in ElastoDyn has about 20
DOFs). For this reason, a C-B methodology was used to recharacterize the
substructure finite-element model into a reduced DOF model that
maintains the fundamental low-frequency response modes of the structure.
With the C-B method, the DOFs of the substructure can be reduced to
about 10 (user defined, see also Section :ref:`CBguide`). This system reduction method
was first introduced by :cite:`hurty1964` and later expanded by :cite:`craig1968`.


.. _GenericCBReduction:

Craig-Bampton reduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we present the generic Craig-Bampton technique. 
The specific application in SubDyn is presented in following sections.
In a C-B reduction, the structure nodes are separated into two
groups: 1) the boundary nodes (identified with a subscript “\ *R*\ ” in
what follows) that include the nodes fully restrained at the base of the
structure and the interface nodes; and 2) the interior nodes (or
leftover nodes, identified with a subscript “\ *L*\ ”).  Note that the DOFs of partially restrained or “free”
nodes at the base of the structure are included in the “L” subset in
this version of SubDyn that contains SSI capabilities.

The derivation of the system reduction is shown below. The system equation of motion of Eq. :eq:`main` can be partitioned as
follows:

.. math::  :label: main2

        \begin{bmatrix} 
        	M_{RR} & M_{RL} \\
             M_{LR} & M_{LL} 
        \end{bmatrix} 
        \begin{bmatrix} 
        	\ddot{U}_R \\ 
            \ddot{U}_L 
        \end{bmatrix} +
        \begin{bmatrix} 
	         	C_{RR} & C_{RL} \\
	            C_{LR} & C_{LL} \\
        \end{bmatrix}
         \begin{bmatrix} 
	        	\dot{U}_R \\ 
	            \dot{U}_L 
        \end{bmatrix} +
        \begin{bmatrix}
            K_{RR} & K_{RL} \\
			K_{LR} & K_{LL} \\
        \end{bmatrix} 
        \begin{bmatrix} 
        	U_R \\ 
            U_L \\
        \end{bmatrix} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            F_R \\
            F_L \\
         \end{bmatrix}  

where the subscript *R* denotes the boundary DOFs (there are *R* DOFs), and
the subscript *L* the interior DOFs (there are *L* DOFs).
In Eq. :eq:`main2`, the applied forces include external forces (e.g., hydrodynamic
forces and those transmitted through the TP to the substructure), gravity and pretension forces which are considered static forces lumped at each node.

The fundamental assumption of the C-B method is that the contribution to
the displacement of the interior nodes can be simply approximated by a
subset :math:`q_m` ( :math:`{q_m \leq L}` ) of the interior generalized DOFs ( :math:`q_L` ). The relationship
between physical DOFs and generalized DOFs can be written as:

.. math::  :label: CB1

        \begin{bmatrix} 
        	U_R \\ 
            U_L 
        \end{bmatrix} =
	  \begin{bmatrix} 
        	I & 0 \\
           \Phi_R & \Phi_L 
        \end{bmatrix} 
        \begin{bmatrix} 
        	U_R \\ 
            q_L 
        \end{bmatrix}
      
where *I* is the identity matrix; :math:`{\Phi_R}` is the (*L*\ ×\ *R*) matrix of Guyan modes, 
which represents the
physical displacements of the interior nodes for static, rigid body
motions at the boundary (interface nodes’ DOFs, because the restrained
nodes DOFs are locked by definition). By considering the homogeneous,
static version of :eq:`main2`, the second row can be manipulated to yield:

.. math::  :label: CB2

	[K_{LR}] {U_R} + [K_{LL}]{U_L} ={0}

Rearranging and considering yields:

.. math::  :label: PhiR

	\Phi_R = -K_{LL}^{-1} K_{LR}

where the brackets have been removed for simplicity.
If the structure is unconstrained, the matrix :math:`{\Phi_R}`
corresponds to rigid body modes, ensuring that the internal nodes follow the rigid body
displacements imposed by the interface DOFs. This has been verified analytically using the
stiffness matrix of a single beam element.  
:math:`{\Phi_L}` (*L*\ ×\ *L* matrix) represents the internal eigenmodes, i.e., the
natural modes of the system restrained at the boundary (interface and
bottom nodes), and can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem:

.. math::  :label: PhiL1

	K_{LL} \Phi_L = \omega^2 M_{LL} \Phi_L

The eigenvalue problem in Eq. :eq:`PhiL1` leads to the reduced basis of generalized
modal DOFs :math:`q_m`, which are chosen as the first few (*m*) eigenvectors that
are arranged by increasing eigenfrequencies. :math:`\Phi_L` is mass normalized, so
that:

.. math::  :label: PhiL2

	\Phi_L^T  M_{LL} \Phi_L = I

By then reducing the number of generalized DOFs to *m* ( :math:`{\le L}`),
:math:`{\Phi_m}` is the matrix (:math:`{(L\times m)}` ) 
chosen to denote the truncated set of :math:`{\Phi_L}` (keeping *m* of the total internal
modes, hence *m* columns), and  :math:`{\Omega_m}` is the diagonal (*m*\ ×\ *m*) matrix
containing the corresponding eigenfrequencies (i.e., :math:`\Phi_m^T K_{LL} \Phi_m=\Omega_m^2`).
In SubDyn, the user
decides how many modes to retain, including possibly zero or all modes.
Retaining zero modes corresponds to a Guyan (static) reduction;
retaining all modes corresponds to keeping the full finite-element
model.

The C-B transformation is therefore represented by the coordinate transformation matrix 
:math:`T_{\Phi_m}` as:

.. _TP2Interface:

Boundary nodes: fixed DOFs and rigid connection to TP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we present the treatment of the boundary nodes: fixed DOFs are eliminated, and interface DOFs are condensed via a rigid connection to the TP reference point. 

The boundary nodes are partitioned into those at the interface, :math:`{\bar{U}_R}`,
and those at the bottom, which are fixed:

.. math:: :label: UR

	U_R = \begin{bmatrix}
		\bar{U}_R \\
		0 
	      \end{bmatrix}
		

The overhead bar here and below denotes matrices/vectors after the
fixed-bottom boundary conditions are applied. 

The interface nodes are
assumed to be rigidly connected among one another and to the TP reference point, hence it is convenient to use
rigid-body TP DOFs (one node with 6 DOFs at the TP reference point) in
place of the interface DOFs. The interface DOFs, :math:`{\bar{U}_R}`, and the TP DOFs are
related to each other as follows:

.. math:: :label: UTP

	\bar{U}_R = T_I U_{TP}

where :math:`T_I` is a :math:`{\left(6 NIN \right) \times 6}` matrix, :math:`NIN` is the number of interface nodes, and :math:`{U_{TP}}` is the 6 DOFs
of the rigid transition piece. The matrix :math:`T_I` can be written as follows:

.. math:: :label: TI

   T_I=	\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 & 0           & \Delta Z_1 & - \Delta Y_1 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & -\Delta Z_1 & 0 & - \Delta X_1 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & \Delta Y_1 &  - \Delta X_1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1   \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots &  \vdots & \vdots \\
	1 & 0 & 0 & 0           & \Delta Z_i & - \Delta Y_i \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & -\Delta Z_i & 0 & - \Delta X_i \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & \Delta Y_i &  - \Delta X_i & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1   \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots &  \vdots & \vdots \\
	\end{bmatrix}, \left( i= 1, 2, \cdots,NIN \right)

with

.. math:: :label: DXYZ
    :nowrap:

    \begin{align}
        \Delta X_i &= X_{INi} - X_{TP} \nonumber\\
        \Delta Y_i &= Y_{INi} - Y_{TP}  \\
        \Delta Z_i &= Z_{INi} - Z_{TP} \nonumber 
    \end{align}


where :math:`{ \left( X_{INi}, Y_{INi}, Z_{INi} \right) }` are the coordinates 
of the :math:`{i^{th}}` interface node and :math:`{ \left( X_{TP}, Y_{TP}, Z_{TP} \right) }`
are the coordinates of the TP reference point within the global coordinate system.

In terms of TP DOFs, the system equation of motion :eq:`main3` after the boundary
constraints are applied (the rows and columns corresponding to the DOFs
of the nodes that are restrained at the seabed are removed from the
equation of motion) becomes:

.. math:: :label: main4

        \begin{bmatrix}
             \tilde{F}_{TP} \\
             F_m  
         \end{bmatrix}

        \tilde{M}_{BB} &= T_I^T \bar{M}_{BB} T_I, \quad
        \tilde{C}_{BB}  = T_I^T \bar{C}_{BB} T_I, \quad 
        \tilde{K}_{BB}  = T_I^T \bar{K}_{BB} T_I   \\

    \end{align}

and :math:`\tilde{M}_{mB}= \tilde{M}_{Bm}^T`, :math:`\tilde{C}_{mB} = \tilde{C}_{Bm}^T`. 

Equation :eq:`main4` represents the equations of motion of the substructure after
the C-B reduction. The total DOFs of the substructure are reduced from
(6 x total number of nodes) to (6 + *m*).

During initialization, SubDyn calculates: the parameter matrices :math:`{\tilde{M}_{BB}, \tilde{M}_{mB}, \tilde{M}_{Bm}, \tilde{K}_{BB}, \Phi_m, \Phi_R, T_I}`; constant load arrays ; and the internal frequency matrix :math:`\Omega_m` . The
substructure response at each time step can then be obtained by using
the state-space formulation discussed in the next section.


.. _Loads:

Loads 
~~~~~

In this section we details the loads acting on the boundary (*R*), interior (*L*) and transition piece node (*TP*). External forces included in the FEM representation, such as the gravity forces, or the pretension forces are noted with the subscript *g*.
The forces at the boundary nodes can be broken down into external loads (*e*, e.g., hydrodynamic
forces, mooring forces), those transferred to and from ElastoDyn via the TP (ED), and the FEM loads:

.. math:: :label: FR

	F_R =F_{R,e} + F_{R, \text{ED}} + F_{R,g}

The forces at the internal nodes are the external loads from other modules (e.g. hydrodynamic), and the FEM loads (e.g. gravity):

.. math:: :label: FL

	F_L =F_{L,e} + F_{L,g}

Conversely, the TP reaction force, i.e., the force applied to the substructure
through the TP, is denoted by:

.. math:: :label: FTP1
	
	F_{TP} = T_I^T F_{R,\textit{ED}} 


The Guyan TP force, :math:`\tilde{F}_{TP}`, and the CB force, :math:`F_m`, given in Eq. :eq:`tilde_partitions0` is then given by:

.. math:: :label: FTPtilde
	
       \tilde{F}_{TP} &= F_{TP} + T_I^T \left[ \bar{F}_{R,e}+ \bar{F}_{R,g} + \bar{\Phi}_{R}^T \left( F_{L,e} + F_{L,g} \right) \right]

       F_m & = \Phi_m^t \left(F_{L,e}  +  F_{L,g}\right)


.. _SSformulation:

State-Space Formulation    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A state-space formulation of the substructure structural dynamics
problem was devised to integrate SubDyn within the FAST modularization
framework. The state-space formulation was developed in terms of inputs,
outputs, states, and parameters. The notations highlighted here are
consistent with those used in Jonkman (2013). Inputs (identified by *u*)
are a set of values supplied to SubDyn that, along with the states, are
needed to calculate future states and the system’s output. Outputs (*y*)
are a set of values calculated by and returned from SubDyn that depend
on the states, inputs, and/or parameters through output equations (with
functions *Y*). States are a set of internal values of SubDyn that are
influenced by the inputs and used to calculate future state values and
the output. In SubDyn, only continuous states are considered. Continuous
states (*x*) are states that are differentiable in time and
characterized by continuous time differential equations (with functions
*X*). Parameters (*p*) are a set of internal system values that are
independent of the states and inputs. Furthermore, parameters can be
fully defined at initialization and characterize the system’s state
equations and output equations.

In SubDyn, the inputs are defined as:

.. math:: :label: inputs

	u = \begin{bmatrix}
		u_1 \\ 
		u_2 \\
		u_3 \\
		u_4 \\
		u_5 \\
	     \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
	     			U_{TP} \\
	     			\dot{U}_{TP}  \\
	     			\ddot{U}_{TP}  \\
	     			F_{L,e} \\
	     			F_{R,e} \\
	     		     \end{bmatrix}
	     			

where :math:`F_L` are the hydrodynamic forces on every interior node of the
substructure from HydroDyn, and :math:`F_{HDR}` are the analogous forces at the boundary
nodes; :math:`{ U_{TP},\dot{U}_{TP},\text{ and } \ddot{U}_{TP}}` are TP deflections (6 DOFs), velocities, and
accelerations, respectively. For SubDyn in stand-alone mode (uncoupled
from FAST), :math:`F_{L,e}` and :math:`F_{R,e}` are assumed to be zero.

In first-order form, the states are defined as:

.. math:: :label: states

	x = \begin{bmatrix}
		x_1 \\ 
		x_2 \\
     \end{bmatrix} 
     = \begin{bmatrix}
        q_m  \\
        \dot{q}_m  \\
     \end{bmatrix}
	     		     
	     		     
From the system equation of motion, the state equation corresponding to
Eq. :eq:`main4` can be written as a standard linear system state equation:

.. math:: :label: state_eq

	\dot{x} = X = A x +Bu + F_X

These state matrices are obtained by isolating the mode accelerations, :math:`\ddot{q}_m` from the second block row of Eq. :eq:`main4` as:

.. math:: :label: ddotqm
    :nowrap:
                 
    \begin{align}
    \ddot{q}_m =  \underbrace{\Phi_m^T(F_{L,e} + F_{L,g})}_{F_m}
                - \tilde{M}_{mB} \ddot{U}_{TP}
                - \tilde{C}_{mB} \dot{U}_{TP}
                - \tilde{C}_{mm} \dot{q}_m
                - \tilde{K}_{mm} q_m
     \end{align}

leading to the following identification:

.. math:: :label: ABFx

    A = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & I \\ 
        -\tilde{K}_{mm} & -\tilde{C}_{mm}
        \end{bmatrix}
    ,\quad
    B = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
        0 & -\tilde{C}_{mB} & -\tilde{M}_{mB} & \Phi_m^T & 0
    \end{bmatrix} 
    ,\qquad
    F_X = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\ 
        \Phi_m^T F_{L,g}
    \end{bmatrix} 


In SubDyn, the outputs to the ElastoDyn module are the reaction forces at the transition piece :math:`F_{TP}`:

.. math:: :label: smally1

	y1 = Y_1 =-F_{TP}

By examining Eq. :eq:`main4` and Eq. :eq:`FTPtilde`, the force is extracted from the first block row as:


.. math:: :label: FTP2
    :nowrap:
                 
    \begin{align}
	F_{TP} =& \tilde{M}_{BB}\ddot{U}_{TP} +   \tilde{M}_{Bm} \ddot{q}_m 
            \\
           &+ \tilde{C}_{BB}\dot{U}_{TP} +  \tilde{C}_{Bm} \dot{q}_m 
            + \tilde{K}_{BB} U_{TP} 
            - T_I^T \left(\bar{F}_{R,e} + \bar{F}_{R,g} + \bar{\Phi}_R(F_{L,e} + F_{L,g}) \right)
              \nonumber
    \end{align}


Inserting the expression of  :math:`\ddot{q}_m` into :math:`F_{TP}` leads to:

..     F_{TP} =& \tilde{M}_{BB}\ddot{U}_{TP} 
             +   \tilde{M}_{Bm} \left[
                       \Phi_m^T(F_L + F_{L,g})
                     - \tilde{M}_{mB} \ddot{U}_{TP}
                     - \tilde{C}_{mB} \dot{U}_{TP}            
                     - \tilde{C}_{mm} \dot{q}_m          
                     - \tilde{K}_{mm} q_m
                       \right] 
                       \nonumber\\
             &+ \tilde{C}_{BB}\dot{U}_{TP} +  \tilde{C}_{Bm} \dot{q}_m
             + \tilde{K}_{BB} U_{TP} 
             - T_I^T \left(\bar{F}_{HDR} + \bar{F}_{Rg} + \bar{\Phi}_R(F_{L,e} + F_{L,g}) \right)
           \nonumber\\
.. math:: :label: FTP3
    :nowrap:
                 
    \begin{align}
     F_{TP} =& 
      \left[              - \tilde{M}_{Bm}\tilde{K}_{mm}  \right] q_m
     +\left[\tilde{C}_{Bm}- \tilde{M}_{Bm}\tilde{C}_{mm}  \right] \dot{q}_m
     \\ 
     &+\left[\tilde{K}_{BB}                                \right]  U_{TP} 
     +\left[\tilde{C}_{BB} -\tilde{M}_{Bm} \tilde{C}_{mB} \right] \dot{U}_{TP}            
     +\left[\tilde{M}_{BB} -\tilde{M}_{Bm} \tilde{M}_{mB} \right] \ddot{U}_{TP}            
    \nonumber \\ 
     &+\left[\tilde{M}_{Bm}\Phi_m^T - T_I^T \bar{\Phi}_R^T \right] \left(F_{L,e} + F_{L,g}\right)
     +\left[ -T_I^T \right]\left(\bar{F}_{R,e} + \bar{F}_{R,g}\right)
    \nonumber
    \end{align}


The output equation for :math:`y_1` can now be identified as:

.. math:: :label: bigY1

	 -Y_1 = F_{TP} = C_1 x + D_1 \bar{u} + F_{Y1}
	 
where


.. math:: :label: C1D1FY1u
    :nowrap:

    \begin{align}
        C_1 &= \begin{bmatrix} 
        -\tilde{M}_{Bm} \tilde{K}_{mm} & \tilde{C}_{Bm}-\tilde{M}_{Bm} \tilde{C}_{mm} 
        \end{bmatrix}
            \nonumber\\
        D_1 &= \begin{bmatrix} 
            \tilde{K}_{BB} & \tilde{C}_{BB} -\tilde{M}_{Bm} \tilde{C}_{mB} & \tilde{M}_{BB} - \tilde{M}_{Bm} \tilde{M}_{mB} & \tilde{M}_{Bm} \Phi_m^T - T_I^T \bar{\Phi}_R^T  & -T_I^T

    \nonumber\\
        F_{Y1} &= \begin{bmatrix}  \tilde{M}_{Bm} \Phi_m^T F_{L,g} - T_I^T \left( \bar{F}_{R,g} + \bar{\Phi}_R^T F_{L,g} \right) \end{bmatrix}
    \\
        \bar{u} &= \begin{bmatrix}
        U_{TP} \\
        \dot{U}_{TP}  \\

        \bar{F}_{R,e} 
        \end{bmatrix}
    \nonumber
    \end{align}
        
        
Note that the overbar is used on the input vector to denote that the
forces apply to the interface nodes only.

The outputs to HydroDyn and other modules are the deflections,
velocities, and accelerations of the substructure:

.. math:: :label: y2

	y_2= Y_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
        	\bar{U}_R \\
                     U_L  \\
           	\dot{\bar{U}}_R  \\
           	\dot{U}_L \\
           	\ddot{\bar{U}}_R  \\
           	\ddot{U}_L \\
	     \end{bmatrix}



From the CB coordinate transformation (Eq. :eq:`CB3`), and the link between boundary nodes and TP node (Eq. :eq:`UTP`) the motions are given as:

.. math:: :label: y2motions

        \bar{U}_R  &= T_I U_{TP} 
        ,\qquad
        \bar{U}_L  = \bar{\Phi}_R \bar{U}_R + \Phi_m q_m

        \dot{\bar{U}}_R  &= T_I \dot{U}_{TP} 
        ,\qquad
        \dot{\bar{U}}_L  = \bar{\Phi}_R \dot{\bar{U}}_R + \Phi_m \dot{q}_m

        \ddot{\bar{U}}_R  &= T_I \ddot{U}_{TP} 
        ,\qquad
        \ddot{\bar{U}}_L  = \bar{\Phi}_R \ddot{\bar{U}}_R + \Phi_m \ddot{q}_m

Using the expression of :math:`\ddot{q}m` from Eq. :eq:`ddotqm`, the internal accelerations are:


.. math:: :label: y2internalacc

        \ddot{\bar{U}}_L  = \bar{\Phi}_R T_I \ddot{U}_{TP} + \Phi_m\left[\Phi_m^T(F_{L,e} + F_{L,g})
                - \tilde{M}_{mB} \ddot{U}_{TP}
                - \tilde{C}_{mB} \dot{U}_{TP}
                - \tilde{C}_{mm} \dot{q}_m
                - \tilde{K}_{mm} q_m \right]




The output equation for :math:`y_2`: can then be written as:

  Y_2 = C_2 x + D_2 u + F_{Y2}
  
  
where

.. math:: :label:  C2D2FY2

           \Phi_m & 0 \\
           0 & 0 \\
           0 & \Phi_m \\
           0 & 0 \\
       -\Phi_m \tilde{K}_{mm} & -\Phi_m \tilde{C}_{mm} \\
          \end{bmatrix}

    D_2 &= \begin{bmatrix}
           T_I & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
           \bar{\Phi}_R T_I & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
           0 & T_I  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
           0 & \bar{\Phi}_R T_I & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
           0 & 0 & T_I  & 0 & 0  \\
           0 & -\Phi_m \tilde{C}_{mB} & \bar{\Phi}_R T_I - \Phi_m \tilde{M}_{mB} &  \Phi_m \Phi_m^T & 0 
          \end{bmatrix}

    F_{Y2}& = \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           0 \\
           0 \\
           0 \\
           0 \\
           \Phi_m \Phi_m^T F_{L,g} 
          \end{bmatrix}

The expression for :math:`F_{Y2}` will be modified by the SIM method and Eq. :eq:`bigY2sim` is used instead.



The above neglected the influence of the lever arm introduced by the TP
displacements. The force and moments exchanged at the TP with ElastoDyn,
are written :math:`F_{TP0}=\left\{f_{TP0}, m_{TP0} \right\}^{T}`. They are related to
:math:`F_{TP}`  as:

.. math::

   F_{TP}=\begin{Bmatrix}
   f_{TP} \\
   m_{TP} \\
   \end{Bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
    I & 0 \\
   \left[u_{TP} \right]_{\times} & I \\
   \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}
   f_{TP0} \\
   m_{TP0} \\
   \end{Bmatrix}

where :math:`\left[u_{TP} \right]_{\times}` is the skew symmetric
matrix representing the cross product with the vector
:math:`u_TP`. This equation is inverted as:

.. math::

   F_{TP0}=\begin{Bmatrix}
   f_{TP0} \\
   m_{TP0} \\
   \end{Bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
    I & 0 \\
   -\left[u_{TP} \right]_{\times}& I \\
   \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}
   f_{TP} \\
   m_{TP} \\
   \end{Bmatrix}
   = F_{TP}
   +
   \begin{Bmatrix}
   0 \\
   -\left[u_{TP} \right]_{\times} f_{TP} \\
   \end{Bmatrix}

The output equation is now rewritten such that :math:`y_1= -F_{TP0}`.
The input file flag **ExtraMom** is used to include the or omit the contribution from 
:math:`-\left[u_{TP} \right]_{\times} f_{TP}` to the output equation. 




Member Force Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SubDyn can also calculate member forces by starting from the forces
computed at the nodes of the elements that are contained in the member
as:

.. math:: :label: el_loads

	\text{Element Inertia load:} ~~ F_I^e = [m] \ddot{U}_e 
	
	\text{Element Static load:} ~~ F_S^e = [k] U_e 
 
where [*k*] and [*m*] are element stiffness and mass matrices, respectively. And
:math:`U_e` and :math:`\ddot{U}_e` are element nodal deflections and accelerations respectively,
which can be obtained from Eq. :eq:`y2`.

There is no good way to quantify the damping forces for each element, so
the element damping forces are not calculated.

Reaction Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reactions at the base of the structure are the member forces at the
base nodes. These are usually provided in member local reference frames.
Additionally, the user may request an overall reaction
:math:`\overrightarrow{R}` (six forces and moments) lumped at the center
of the substructure (tower centerline) and mudline, i.e., at the
reference point (0,0,-**WtrDpth**) in the global reference frame, with
**WtrDpth** denoting the water depth. :math:`\overrightarrow{R}` is a
six-element array that can be calculated in matrix form as follows:

.. math:: :label: reaction

	\overrightarrow{R} = \begin{bmatrix}
				F_{X} \\
 				\vdots \\
				M_{Z} \\
			     \end{bmatrix} = T_{\text{React}} F_{\text{React}}
			     

where :math:`F_{\text{React}}` is a (6*N\ :sub:`React`) array
containing the forces and moments at the *N\ :sub:`react`* restrained
nodes in the global coordinate frame, and :math:`T_{\text{React}}` is a
( :math:`{6×6 N_{\text{React}}}` ) matrix, as follows:

.. math:: :label: Treact

	T_{\text{React}} = \begin{bmatrix}
		1  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0  & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0  & -\Delta Z_1 & \Delta Y_1   & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0                 & -\Delta Z_{Nreact} & \Delta Y_{Nreact}   & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		\Delta Z_1 & 0   & -\Delta X_1  & 0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & \Delta Z_{Nreact} & 0                  &  -\Delta X_{Nreact} & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		\Delta Y_1 & \Delta X_1     & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & \Delta Y_{Nreact} & \Delta X_{Nreact}  & 0                   & 0 & 0 & 1 
			\end{bmatrix}

where :math:`{X_i,~Y_i}`, and :math:`Z_i` (:math:`{i = 1 .. N_{\text{React}}}`) are coordinates of
the boundary nodes with respect to the reference point. For each element
with a restrained node, :math:`F_{\text{React}}` is calculated starting
from :math:`F_S^e` --- see Eq. :eq:`el_loads` --- subtracting out the contributions of gravity --- :math:`F_G`, see Eq. :eq:`FG`
and hydrodynamic loads (:math:`F_{HDR}`) at the restrained node. No direct
element-level inertial or damping effect is therefore included in the
reaction calculation.



.. _TimeIntegration:

Time Integration  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At time :math:`{t=0}`, the initial states are specified as initial conditions (all
assumed to be zero in SubDyn) and the initial inputs are supplied to
SubDyn. During each subsequent time step, the inputs and states are
known values, with the inputs :math:`u(t)` coming from ElastoDyn and HydroDyn, and
the states :math:`x(t)` known from the previous time-step integration. All of the
parameter matrices are calculated in the SubDyn initiation module. With
known :math:`u(t)` and :math:`x(t)`, :math:`{\dot{x}(t)}` can be calculated using the state equation :math:`{\dot{x}(t)=X(u,x,t)}` (see Eq. :eq:`state_eq`), and
the outputs :math:`y_1(t)` and :math:`y_2(t)` can be calculated solving Eqs. :eq:`bigY1` and :eq:`bigY2`. The element forces
can also be calculated using Eq. :eq:`el_loads`. The next time-step states :math:`{x(t + \Delta t)}` are
obtained by integration:

.. math:: :label: integration

	\left [ u(t), \dot{x}(t), x(t) \right ] \xrightarrow[]{\text{Integrate}}  x(t + \Delta t)
	
	
For loose coupling, SubDyn uses its own integrator, whereas for tight
coupling, the states from all the modules will be integrated
simultaneously using an integrator in the glue-code. SubDyn’s built-in
time integrator options for loose coupling are:

-  Fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta

-  Fourth-order explicit Adams-Bashforth predictor

-  Fourth-order explicit Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector

-  Implicit second-order Adams-Moulton.

For more information, consult any numerical methods reference, e.g.,
:cite:`chapra2010`.


.. _SD_DampingSpecifications:

Damping specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


There are three ways to specify the damping associated with the motion
of the interface node in SubDyn: no damping, Rayleigh damping or user defined 6x6 matrix.

NOTE: Damping associated with joints is not documented yet and would change the developments below.

When **GuyanDampMod=0**, SubDyn assumes zero damping for the Guyan modes, and modal damping for the CB modes, with no cross couplings:

.. math::  :label: dampingassumptions

            C_{BB} =  \tilde{C}_{BB} &=0 

        C_{Bm} =C_{mB} = \tilde{C}_{Bm}=\tilde{C}_{mB}&=0 

            C_{mm} = \tilde{C}_{mm} &=  2\zeta \Omega_m                

In other words, the only damping matrix term retained is the one
associated with internal DOF damping. This assumption has implications
on the damping at the interface with the turbine system, as discussed in
Section :ref:`TowerTurbineCpling`. The diagonal (*m*\ ×\ *m*) :math:`\zeta` matrix contans the modal
damping ratios corresponding to each retained internal mode. In SubDyn,
the user provides damping ratios (in percent of critical damping
coefficients) for the retained modes.

When **GuyanDampMod=1**, SubDyn assumes Rayleigh Damping for the Guyan modes, and modal damping for the CB modes, with no cross couplings:


.. math::  :label: dampingRayleigh

        \tilde{C}_{BB}&=\alpha \tilde{M}_{BB} + \beta \tilde{K}_{BB}

        \tilde{C}_{Bm}=\tilde{C}_{mB}&=0 

        \tilde{C}_{mm} &=  2\zeta \Omega_m  

where :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` are the mass and stiffness proportional Rayleigh damping coefficients.  The damping is directly applied to the tilde matrices, that is, the matrices related to the 6 DOF of the TP node.

The case **GuyanDampMod=2**, is similar to the previous case, except that the user specifies the :math:`6\times6` terms of :math:`\tilde{C}_{BB}`.








.. _sim:

Static-Improvement Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To account for the effects of static gravity (member self-weight) and
buoyancy forces, one would have to include all of the structural axial
modes in the C-B reduction. This inclusion often translates into
hundreds of modes to be retained for practical problems. An alternative
method is thus promoted to reduce this limitation and speed up SubDyn.
This method is denoted as SIM, and computes two static solutions at each
time step: one based on the full system stiffness matrix and one based
on the reduced stiffness matrix. The dynamic solution then proceeds as
described in the previous sections, and at each time step the
time-varying dynamic solution is superimposed on the difference between
the two static solutions, which amounts to quasi-statically accounting
for the contribution of those modes not directly included within the
dynamic solution.

The SIM formulation provides a correction for the displacements of the
internal nodes. The uncorrected displacements, as obtained from the
previous C-B formulation , are now noted :math:`{\hat{U}}_{L}`, while
the corrected displacements are noted :math:`_{}`. The SIM correction
consists in and adding the total static deflection of all the internal
DOFs (:math:`U_{L0}`), and subtracting the static deflection associated
with C-B modes (:math:`U_{L0m}`), as cast in :eq:`SIM` :

.. math::   :label: SIM

   U_L = \hat{U}_L + U_{L0} - U_{L0m} = \underbrace{\Phi_R U_R + \Phi_m q_m}_{\hat{U}_L}  +  \underbrace{\Phi_L q_{L0}}_{U_{L0}} - \underbrace{\Phi_m q_{m0}}_{U_{L0m}} 
 

.. where the expression for :math:`U_{L0}` and :math:`U_{L0m}` will be derived in the next paragraph.
   will be derived in the next paragraph. Eq. :eq:`SIM` can be rewritten as:
            \begin{bmatrix} 
                U_R \\ 
                    U_L 
            \end{bmatrix} =
          \begin{bmatrix} 
                I & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
               \Phi_R & \Phi_m & \Phi_L & -\Phi_m 
            \end{bmatrix} 
            \begin{bmatrix} 
                U_R \\ 
                    q_m \\
                    q_{L0} \\
                    q_{m0}
            \end{bmatrix}
    with:
        U_{L0} = \Phi_L q_{L0}, \qquad U_{L0m} = \Phi_m q_{m0}

where :math:`{q_{m0}}` and :math:`{q_{L0}}` are the *m* and *L* modal coefficients that are assumed to be
operating in a static fashion. These coefficients are
calculated under the C-B hypothesis that the boundary nodes are fixed.
The static displacement vectors can be calculated as follows:


.. math::  :label: SIM3
	
	K_{LL} U_{L0} = F_{L,e} + F_{L,g}

By pre-multiplying both sides times , Eq. :eq:`SIM3` can be
rewritten as: :math:`{\Phi_L^T K_{LL} \Phi_L q_{L0} = \Phi_L^T  \left( F_{L,e} + F_{L,g} \right) = \tilde{F}_L }` or, recalling that :math:`{\Phi_L^T K_{LL} \Phi_L = \Omega_L^2}`, as: :math:`{\Omega_L^2 q_{L0} =\tilde{F}_L }`, or equivalently in terms of :math:`U_{L0}`:

.. math::  :label: UL02

	U_{L0} = \Phi_L \left[ \Omega_L^2 \right]^{-1} \tilde{F}_L 

Similarly:

.. math::  :label: UL0m2

   K_{LL} U_{L0m} = F_{L,e} + F_{L,g} \quad\rightarrow \quad U_{L0m} = \Phi_m \left[ \Omega_m^2 \right]^{-1} \tilde{F}_m 

with :math:`\tilde{F}_m =\Phi_m^T(F_{L,e} + F_{L,g})`.
Note that: :math:`{ \dot{U}_{L0} = \dot{q}_{L0} = \dot{U}_{L0m} = \dot{q}_{m0} =0 }` and :math:`{ \ddot{U}_{L0} = \ddot{q}_{L0} = \ddot{U}_{L0m} = \ddot{q}_{m0} =0 }`.

The dynamic component :math:`{ \hat{U} = \begin{bmatrix} \hat{U}_R \\ \hat{U}_R \end{bmatrix} }` is calculated following the usual procedure
described in :numref:`SSformulation` to :numref:`TimeIntegration`. For example, states are still
calculated and integrated as in Eq. :eq:`state_eq`, and the output to ElastoDyn, i.e.,
the reaction provided by the substructure at the TP interface, is also
calculated as it was done previously in Eqs. :eq:`smally1` and :eq:`bigY1`.

However, the state-space formulation is slightly modified  
(simply adding the contribution :math:`U_{L0}-U_{L0m}` to :math:`F_{Y2}` 
when computing the outputs to HydroDyn as:

.. math:: :label: y2sim

	y_2= \begin{bmatrix}
        	\bar{U}_R \\
                     U_L  \\
           	\dot{\bar{U}}_R  \\
           	\dot{U}_L \\
           	\ddot{\bar{U}}_R  \\
           	\ddot{U}_L \\
	     \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}  
	     	\bar{U}_R \\
	     	\hat{U}_L + \boldsymbol{U_{L0} - U_{L0m}} \\
	     	\dot{\bar{U}}_R  \\
		\dot{U}_L \\
		\ddot{\bar{U}}_R  \\
           	\ddot{U}_L \\
	     \end{bmatrix}

The array :math:`F_{Y2}` from Eq. :eq:`bigY2` is now defined as follows:

.. math:: :label: bigY2sim

	F_{Y2} &= \begin{bmatrix}
	       0 \\
	       \boldsymbol{U_{L0} - U_{L0m}} \\
	       0 \\
	       0 \\
	       0 \\
	       \Phi_m \Phi_m^T F_{L,g} 
	      \end{bmatrix}


Finally, the element forces can be calculated as:

.. math:: :label: el_loads_sim

	\text{Element Inertia load:} ~~ F_I^e &= [m] \ddot{U}_e 
	
	\text{Element Static load:} ~~ F_S^e &= [k] U_e = [k] \left[ \hat{U}_e + U_{L0,e} - U_{L0m,e} \right] 
	
with the element node DOFs expressed as:

.. math::  :label: Uesim

	U_e = \hat{U}_e + U_{L0,e} - U_{L0m,e}

where the SIM decomposition is still used with :math:`\hat{U}_e` denoting the
time-varying components of the elements nodes' displacements, and :math:`U_{L0,e}` and :math:`U_{L0m,e}` are
derived from the parent :math:`U_{L0}` and :math:`U_{L0m}` arrays of displacements, respectively.
