SubDyn User Guide and Theory Manual
======================================

.. only:: html

   This manual offers both a quick reference guide and a more in-depth theory guide for the SubDyn software program. 
   It is intended to be used by the general user in combination with the OpenFAST and HydroDyn manuals. 
   The documentation was started from :cite:`subdyn:manual` by Damiani et al.
   The manual will be updated as new releases are issued and as needed to provide further information on advancements or modifications to the software.


   The authors would like to acknowledge the following contributors: R. Damiani, E. Branlard, J. Jonkman, A. Robertson, F. Wendt and B. Barahona. Additional contributors may be found on github.
   We also are grateful to the U.S. Department of Energy Wind and Water Power Program for supporting the development of this software.
