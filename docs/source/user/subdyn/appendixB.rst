Appendix B. OC4 Jacket Driver File
==================================

SubDyn's Driver Input File 
:download:`(OC4 Jacket Driver File) <./examples/OC4_Jacket_SD_Driver.dvr>`: 

This file includes information on the environmental conditions (gravity and water depth), 
numerical-solution parameters (e.g., integration time interval, numer of time-steps), TP reference point coordinates in global reference frame, 
rotation angle of the structure geometry in degrees about the global Z axis, the input mode for the TP reference point displacements, velocities, and accelerations (steady-state or time-series from file) and any related input
file if not steady-state input.
