Building OpenFAST
=================

OpenFAST uses the `CMake <https://cmake.org>`__ build system. 
We recommend building OpenFAST using `Spack <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__. 
However, we also provide some sample scripts in ``openfast/share`` if you choose to proceed without `Spack`.

Dependencies
------------

OpenFAST has the following dependencies:

- LAPACK libraries provided through the variable ``BLASLIB``
- for the C++ API, `HDF5 <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`__ (provided by ``HDF5_ROOT``) and `yaml-cpp <https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp>`__ (provided by ``YAML_ROOT``). 

CMake Build Instructions
------------------------
::

    git clone https://github.com/OpenFAST/OpenFAST.git
    cd OpenFAST
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ../ 
    make 
    
A sample installation shell script is also provided in the ``openfast/share``. Run the script from ``openfast/`` as:
::

    git clone https://github.com/OpenFAST/OpenFAST.git
    cd OpenFAST
    bash share/install.sh

Building OpenFAST Semi-Automatically Using Spack on macOS or Linux
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The following describes how to build OpenFAST and its dependencies
mostly automatically on your Mac using 
`Spack <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__. 
This can also be used as a template to build OpenFAST on any 
Linux system with Spack.

These instructions were developed on macOS 10.11 with the following tools installed via Homebrew:

- GCC 6.3.0
- CMake 3.6.1
- pkg-config 0.29.2

Step 1
~~~~~~

Checkout the official Spack repo from github (we will checkout into ``${HOME}``):

``cd ${HOME} && git clone https://github.com/LLNL/spack.git``

Step 2
~~~~~~

Add Spack shell support to your ``.profile`` by adding the lines:

::

    export SPACK_ROOT=${HOME}/spack
    . $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh

Step 3
~~~~~~

Copy the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenFAST/openfast/dev/share/spack/package.py`__ file
to your installation of Spack:

::
   
    mkdir ${SPACK_ROOT}/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/openfast
    cd ${SPACK_ROOT}/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/openfast
    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenFAST/openfast/dev/share/spack/package.py

Step 4
~~~~~~

Try ``spack info openfast`` to see if Spack works. If it does, check the
compilers you have available by:

::

    machine:~ user$ spack compilers
    ==> Available compilers
    -- gcc ----------------------------------------------------------
    gcc@6.3.0  gcc@4.2.1

    -- clang --------------------------------------------------------
    clang@8.0.0-apple  clang@7.3.0-apple

Step 5
~~~~~~

Install OpenFAST with your chosen version of GCC:

::

    spack install openfast %gcc@6.3.0

To install OpenFAST with the C++ API, do:

::

    spack install openfast+cxx %gcc@6.3.0
    
That should be it! Spack will automatically use the most up-to-date dependencies 
unless otherwise specified. For example to constrain OpenFAST to use some specific 
versions of dependencies you could issue the Spack install command:

::

    spack install openfast %gcc@6.3.0 ^hdf5@1.8.16 

The executables and libraries will be located at

::
   
    spack location -i openfast

    
Add the appropriate paths to your ``PATH`` and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to run OpenFAST.
