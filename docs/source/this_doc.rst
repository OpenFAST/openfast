This documentation
==================

OpenFAST documentation is built using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_, which uses `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ as its markup language. 
Online documentation is hosted on `readthedocs <http://openfast.readthedocs.io>`_, where one can choose between documentation generated from the OpenFAST `master` or `dev` github branches  (if viewing this on http://openfast.readthedocs.io click on  ``Read the Docs`` "box" on the lower left corner of the browser screen for options).  

This documentation is divided into two parts:

:ref:`user_guide`

   Directed towards end-users, this part provides detailed documentation
   regarding installation and usage of the OpenFAST and its underlying modules,
   as well as theory and verification documentation. 
   Also included are instructions for using the automated test suite, which 
   serves as a suite of examples.

:ref:`dev_guide`

   The developer guide is targeted towards users wishing to extend the
   functionality provided within OpenFAST. Here you will find details
   regarding the code structure, API supported by various classes, and links to
   source code documentation extracted using Doxygen.
