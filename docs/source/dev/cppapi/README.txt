We don't currently run doxygen on RTD due to some configuration issues.  So the doxygen content for the cpp was manually run and stored (really not ideal and should be fixed).

doxygenclass and doygenstruct are commented out in the following places.  When doxygen is working, turn these back on.
api.rst:8:    .. doxygenclass:: fast::OpenFAST
index.rst:18: .. doxygenclass:: fast::fastInputs
index.rst:27: .. doxygenstruct:: fast::turbineDataType
