.. _github_workflow:

Working with OpenFAST on GitHub
===============================
The majority of the collaboration and development for OpenFAST takes place
on the `GitHub repository <http://github.com/openfast/openfast>`__. There,
`issues <http://github.com/openfast/openfast/issues>`__ and
`pull requests <http://github.com/openfast/openfast/pulls>`__
are discussed and new versions are released. It is the best mechanism for
engaging with the NREL OpenFAST team and other developers throughout
the OpenFAST community.

Issues and work assignment
--------------------------
Issues should be opened with proper documentation and data to fully describe
the problem or feature gap. It is here that communication and coordination
should happen regarding ongoing work for new development, and developers should
make clear any intention to complete a task.

.. _pull_requests:

Pull Requests
-------------
When a code modification is ready for review, a pull request should be
submitted along with all appropriate documentation and tests. An NREL OpenFAST
team member will assign a reviewer and work with the  developer to have the
code merged into the main repository.

New pull requests should contain the following:

- A description of the need for modifications

  - If the pull request fixes a bug,
    the accompanying GitHub issue should be referenced

- A summary of the work implemented
- Regression test results

  - If all tests pass, the summary print out should be provided
  - If any tests fail, an explanation of the failing
    cases and supporting data like plots should be included

- Updated unit tests, if applicable
- Updated documentation in applicable sections ready for compilation and
  deployment to `readthedocs <http://openfast.readthedocs.io>`__.

Git workflow and interacting with the main repository
-----------------------------------------------------
OpenFAST development should follow "Git Flow" when interacting with the github
repository. Git Flow is a well-defined and widely adopted workflow for using
git that outlines safe methods of pushing and pulling commits to a shared
repository. Maintaining Git Flow is critical to prevent remote changes from
blocking your local development. This workflow is detailed nicely
`here <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model>`__
and the chart below provides a high level perspective.

OpenFAST Specific Git Flow
--------------------------
It is important to consider how your current work will be affected by other
developer's commits and how your commits will affect other developers.
On public branches, avoid using
`git rebase <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing>`__
and never `force push <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#git-push---force>`__.

In OpenFAST development, the typical workflow follows this procedure:

1. Fork the OpenFAST repository on GitHub

2. Clone your new fork

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/<youruser>/OpenFAST

3. Add OpenFAST/OpenFAST as a remote named ``upstream``

.. code-block:: bash

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenFAST/OpenFAST

4. Create a feature branch for active development starting from the OpenFAST
   ``dev`` branch and check it out

.. code-block:: bash

    git branch feature/a_great_feature upstream/dev
    git checkout feature/a_great_feature

5. Add new development on ``feature/a_great_feature``

.. code-block:: bash

    git add a_file.f90
    git commit -m "A message"
    git push origin feature/a_great_feature

6. Update your feature branch with ``upstream``

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull upstream dev
    git push origin feature/a_great_feature

7. Open a new `pull request <https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast/compare>`__
   to merge ``<youruser>/OpenFAST/feature/a_great_feature`` into
   ``OpenFAST/OpenFAST/dev``
