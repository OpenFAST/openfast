Developer Documentation
=======================

**Our goal as developers is to ensure that OpenFAST is a sustainable open
source software that is well tested and well documented.** To that end, we
continually work to improve the documentation and test coverage along with
feature additions and improvements. This section of the documentation outlines
the processes and procedures we have established for external developers
to work with the NREL OpenFAST team on code development.

If you'd like to help with general OpenFAST development or work on a particular
feature, then first install OpenFAST following the
:doc:`installation instructions <../install/index>` for your machine. Next,
verify that your installation is valid by running the test suite following the
:doc:`testing instructions <../testing/index>`.

After a successful and validated build, we encourage reading through the
:doc:`OpenFAST development philosophy <dev_phil>` to understand the general
workflow for individual and coordinated development. Finally, be sure to review
the :doc:`GitHub workflow <github_workflow>` to avoid any merge or code
conflicts.

With development happening in parallel between NREL, industry partners, and
universities, NREL relies on these GitHub tools to coordinate efforts:

- `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/openfast/openfast/issues>`_ is the place
  to ask usage or development questions, report bugs, and
  suggest code enhancements
- `GitHub Pull Requests <https://github.com/openfast/openfast/pulls>`_
  is the place for engaging with the OpenFAST team to have your new code
  merged into the main repository.

For other questions regarding OpenFAST, please contact
`Mike Sprague <mailto:michael.a.sprague@nrel.gov>`_.
