Developer Documentation
=======================

**Under construction.**

This section of OpenFAST documentation is directed at developers, e.g., those who will be adding new modules, improving existing modules, fixing bugs, etc.  The OpenFAST software repository is on `github.com <https://github.com/openfast/openfast>`_, and we ask that developers make contributions through "pull requests" as described in :numref:`github_workflow`.  
OpenFAST documentation is posted on `readthedocs.com <http://openfast.readthedocs.io/>`_; that documentation is generated automatically from both the ``master`` and ``dev`` branches on `github.com <https://github.com/openfast/openfast>`_ whenever new material is committed.  
However, documentation can be generated on a local machine as described in :numref:`build_doc`.  Note that on the `readthedocs.com <http://openfast.readthedocs.io/>`_ site, one can build a PDF of the documentation (click on lower left corner for options).
