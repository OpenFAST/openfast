			NWTC_Subs Change Log
			--------------------

2004-03-19  M. Buhl, J. Jonkman, B. Jonkman
 The first official release of NWTC_Subs.  So far, the only routines included
 are those needed by FAST, TurbSim, and WT_Perf.

2004-04-22  M. Buhl
 I added CompDR() to NWTC_Subs.f90.  It calculates the blade-segment lengths
  from the node locations.

2004-05-03  M. Buhl
 I changed the variable Rn to Re to use the most-common notation for Reynolds number.

2004-06-22  M. Buhl
 I copied FileSize(), WrML(), and Is_NaN() from Crunch to SysVF.F90.

v1.00a-mlb  2004-07-02  M. Buhl
 I added a new NWTCVer variable to NWTC_Mods\ProgMod().  I modified NWTC_Subs\DispNVD()
   to display the library version in addition to the calling program name and version.
 I increased the string length of ProgVer to accomodate the text added for high-
   precision versions.
 I modified NWTC_Subs\CompDR() to generate an error if the blade length is off by more
   than 0.5% and a warning if it is off by 0.1%.  Craig H. asked for that.


v1.00a-mlb  2004-07-07  M. Buhl
 I added INTERFACE blocks to NWTC_Subs to allow the use of the routines to read variables
   or arrays in a generic fashion.
 I created many routines All?Ary1,2,3 to allocated arrays of up to three dimensions
   and added an INTERFACE block to allow the use of the generic routine AllocAry.
   I creates routines for REAL, INTEGER, LOGICAL, and CHARACTER arrays for a total
   of 12 routines.
 I had to fix the ReadCAry() routine in NWTC_Subs.f90.  I can't imagine it had ever
   worked.

v1.00c-mlb  2004-10-15  M. Buhl
 I added an IMPLICIT NONE to the top of the NWTC_Subs.f90 module and eliminated all
   the others in the individual routines.

v1.00d-mlb  2005-02-04  M. Buhl
 I replaced all the $ editing with ADVANCE='NO', which is standard Fortran.  I moved all
   the changed routines and the routines that called them in SysVF.f90 to NWTC_Subs.f90.
 I added ReadStr() to NWTC_Subs.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-02-24  M. Buhl
 I added PiBy2, TwoPi, and TwoPi8 to the NWTC_Const module.
 I added AeroName and AeroVer to the ProgMod() module in NWTC_Mods.f90.
 I added a MPi2Pi routine to ensure an angle is between -Pi and Pi.
 I added Jason's AddOrSub2Pi.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-02-25  M. Buhl
 I added OpenFUnkFile.
 I added PiConsts and removed their initializations in NWTC_Consts.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-03-21  M. Buhl
 I added the Get_Env function to SysVF.f90.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-04-12  M. Buhl
 I added the GL_Loc function to NWTC_Subs.f90.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-06-13  M. Buhl
 I started to add InterpAF() to NWTC_Subs.f90.  It interpolates airfoil tables.
   This major effort will be addressed later.
 I added BSortReal() to NWTC_Subs.f90.  It bubble sorts an array of reals.
 I added SortUnion, which takes two sorted lists and generates a sorted union
   of the two.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-06-24  M. Buhl
 I added subroutine Warn, which works like Abort, but doesn't stop the program.
 I changed the OPEN in OpenUnf to use BINARY instead of UNFORMATTED.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-06-27  M. Buhl
 I added the variables UnfForm and Endian to SysMods.
 I added OpenUInfile() and OpenUOutfile() to NWTC_Subs.f90 for unformatted files.
 I removed OpenUnf() from SysVF.f90.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-07-05  M. Buhl
 I added CheckArgs() (from FAST) to NWTC_Subs.f90.
 I added ACTION="WRITE" to the open statement in OpenFOutFile().

v1.00e-mlb  2005-07-18  M. Buhl
 I had to add "USE Sys_Subs" to CheckArgs() in NWTC_Subs.f90.  Don't know how it
   could have worked before.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-07-22  M. Buhl
 I added a Beep flag to NWTC_Output and modified Abort() and Warn() to test the
   flag.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-07-25  M. Buhl
 I added double-precision versions of all the Pi constants in both the module and
   the initializing routine.
 I added the AeroData derived type to NWTC_Aero to hold interpolated values.
 I added the new routine AeroInt, which is a superset of GetCoefs that also
   interpolates the header data for the AeroDyn airfoil tables.
 I added Cn and Cc to the airfoil tables for the dynamic stall calculations.
   I updated GetAF to fill those tables.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-07-25  M. Buhl
 I added a test in GetAF to ensure that the alpha range is from -180 to 180.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-08-11  M. Buhl
 I modified ReadCVar and ReadStr so the echoed strings are quote delimited.

v1.00e-mlb  2005-11-04  M. Buhl
 I created NameOFile() to name the output file based upon the name of the input
   file that is retrieved from the command line.  This routine uses the Fortran
   2000 intrinsic functions for accessing the command line that came from the
   F2KCLI library.

v1.00f-mlb  2005-11-04  M. Buhl
 I reorganized the routines and modules.  From NWTC_Subs.f90, I created NWTC_IO.f90,
   NWTC_Num.f90, and NWTC_Aero.  I moved variables from NWTC_mods.f90 to the
   appropriate file headers.  I moved the USE and IMPLICIT NONE statements from
   individual routines to the file headers.  I eliminated all the alpha comments.

v1.00f-mlb  2005-11-04  M. Buhl
 I moved OpenBin in SysVF.f90 to NWTC_IO.f90 and changed it so it calls OpenBinFile
   in SysVF.f90.  I pass an Error flag between the two so the system-specific routine
   no longer calls Abort(), which caused a circular reference.

v1.00f-mlb  2005-11-10  B. Jonkman, M. Buhl
 Bonnie found and fixed bugs that crop up in certain situations for FindLine() and WrScr().
 Marshall added GET_COMMAND_COUNT(), GET_COMMAND(), and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT() to SysSubs
   to mimic the built-in Fortran 2000 routines.
 Jason requested a complex version of InterpStp().  I renamed InterpStp() to InterpStpReal(),
   created an InterpStpComp(), and created a generic interface so invoking InterpStp()
   works with either.  I did something similar for InterpBin().

v1.00  2005-11-10  M. Buhl
 I released version 1.00 to the web.

v1.01  2005-11-10  B. Jonkman
 Bonnie found an error in NWTC_Num.f90/SortUnion() and fixed it.

v1.02  2005-11-15  M. Buhl
 Gunjit complained that my Rho interfered withi his Rho.  I decided that it would be better to
   refer to the air density with a more-specific name, so I renamed Rho to AirDens.  I'll have
   to fix WT_Perf and AeroDyn.
 Gunjit also found that I forgot to compute R2D and R2D_D.  While fixing that, I noticed I was
   using single-precision constants to compute DP Pi constants.

v1.03  2006-01-30  M. Buhl
 I found a problem with OpenUOutfile.  It really seemed to want to open an input file instead.

v1.10  2006-02-02  M. Buhl
 I added functions Mean and StdDev to NWTC_Num.f90.

v1.11  2006-02-02  M. Buhl
 I modified the output statement in NWTC_IO.f90\DispNVD() to eliminate the extra space between
   the name of the library and the version information.

v1.12  2006-02-02  B. Jonkman, M. Buhl
 Bonnie improved NWTC_IO.f90\CheckArgs().
 At Bonnie's urging, Marshall added NWTC_Init() to NWTC_Library.f90.  It calls all routines that
   need to be to make the library work.  Currently, only PiConsts() is included.  He also added
   some notes to the top on the file.
 Bonnie also came up with a mod to NWTC_IO.f90\GetRoot() to deal with people entering file names
   with "." in the path, but no real extension.  Marshall added logic to deal with "." and "..".
 Bonnie also suggested we come up with KIND parameters for all types, so Marshall added a bunch
   to the precision modules.
 In NWTC_IO.f90\CheckArgs(), Marshall changed declarations to use default INTEGERs instead of
   4-byte INTEGERs.
 Marshall created NWTC_IO.f90\ReadNum() to read a word stringfrom input and test to see if it
   starts with a T or F.  If not, it returns the word which can be read for an integer or real.
   This prevents True or False from being valid numeric input.  Both ReadIVar() and ReadRVar()
   were modified to use ReadNum().

v1.01.03  2006-04-25  M. Buhl
 For WT_Perf, I added the constants TwoByPi and TwoByPi_D to NWTC_Num.f90.
 I removed the declaration for FirstChr in NWTC_IO.f90\ReadNum() as it was not being used.
 I modified NWTC_Aero.f90\GetAF() because the allocations for AF_Table%Tab(ITab)%FTB and
   AF_Table%Tab(ITab)%FTBC use the incorrect number of alphas.  I also had to modify an IF for
   the same reason.

v1.01.04  2006-05-12  M. Buhl
 Kelly Londenberg pointed out that I used the wrong index in an error statement in NWTC_Aero.f90\GetAF().
   Instead of NumSeg I needed to use ISeg.

v1.01.05  2006-09-20  M. Buhl
 I changed the unit number for the console (CU) in SysVF.f90 to 7 to work around a bug in IVF that
   manifests itself when using list-directed prints.  I also created a variable to specify the record
   length for the console (ConRecL) and defaulted it to 120.  I had to modify OpenCon to use the new
   variable.

v1.01.06  2007-04-06  M. Buhl
 I renamed NWTC_Num.f90\StdDev() to StdDevFn().
 I got rid of some redundant "Use Precision" and "IMPLICIT NONE" statements.
 I re-added the All?Ary? routines to NWTC_IO.f90.  I do not remember why I removed them.

v1.01.07  2007-09-05  M. Buhl
 I changed Abort() to ProgAbort() and Warn() to ProgWarn() to avoid conflicts with built-in
   routines.

v1.01.08  2007-09-26  M. Buhl
 I modified ReadLVar() so it checks to see if the variable name is not "ECHO" before echoing it.

v1.01.09  2008-01-18  M. Buhl
 Bonnie spotted an error in SingPrec.f90 where I said B4Ki should hold a number as big as 10^10
   instead of 10^9.  I also modified DoubPrec.f90 to do integers the same way as SingPrec.f90.

v1.01.10  2008-11-14  M. Buhl
 When I tried to compile with WT_Perf, I was informed that IOS was not declared in SysIVF.f90\FileSize().

v1.01.11, 2009-12-03  M. Buhl
 I replace the call to ProgExit in NWTC_IO.f90\ProgAbort() with "STOP 1".

v1.02.00 2010-03-16 B. Jonkman
 I fixed an error in NWTC_IO.f90\Flt2LStr() that incorrectly removed zeros after the exponent.
 I fixed typos in NWTC_Aero.f90\AeroInt() and \GetCoefs() where the function GetCoeff() was
   called using the index for the wrong airfoil table. The results shouldn't change, but the
   interpolation might be faster now.
 I added subroutines OpenBInpFile(), ReadRAryLines(), ReadCAryLines(), and ReadAryLines()
   to NWTC_IO.f90.
 I modified NWTC_IO.f90\DispNVD() to use NWTCName instead of hard-coding the name.
 I added subroutine OpenBinInpFile() to Sys*.f90 (I've not tested it in Gnu or IFL)
 I added subroutine Get_CWD() to Sys*.f90 (I've not tested it in Gnu or IFL)
 I've removed variables AeroName and AeroVer from NWTC_Aero.f90 and AirDens, KinVisc,
   and SpdSound from NWTC_Aero.f90. (None of these variables they were used in the library.)
 I created a SysMATLAB.f90 file so that we can write to the MATLAB command window when we use
   Simulink. I moved the WrNR() routine from NWTC_IO to the Sys*.f90 files.  WrNR is not
   "system-specific" per se, but it is the only function outside Sys*.f90 that uses unit CU
   to write to the screen.  Since we don't use CU in Matlab, I moved the routine.  This allows
   all of the Matlab-specific routines to be in one file.
 I added subroutines OpenEcho() and CloseEcho() to NWTC_IO.f90.
 I added optional arguments to subroutines that have potential for errors (calling ProgAbort)
   so that they return an error flag instead of aborting the program.  This will allow us to
   clean up after ourselves when linking with other programs (like Matlab, using the FAST
   S_Function).  This involves changes in NWTC_NUM.f90, NWTC_IO.f90, and NWTC_Aero.f90. I did
   NOT change NWTC_Aero.f90\GetAF() because an optional ErrStat argument in that subroutine
   will be a pain.
 I removed the "STOP 1" call from NWTC_IO.f90\ProgAbort() and added some comments to
   Sys*.f90\ProgExit() to replace EXIT() with STOP, if your compiler doesn't support
   the EXIT() subroutine.
 I changed the length of the argument, Arg, in NWTC_IO.f90\CheckArgs() from 99 to "LEN(InputFile)"
   to allow input file names from the command line to be larger than 99 characters.
 I added Jason Jonkman's SUBROUTINE SmllRotTrans() to NWTC_Num.f90. This routine was previously
   in FAST and HydroCalc.

v1.03.00  2011-11-05  B. Jonkman, M. Buhl, D. Maniaci
 Marshall modified NWTC_Aero.f90 in many places to add the possibility of having Cp,min data in the airfoil tables.
 Marshall modified NWTC_Aero.f90 in many places to add the ability to read control settings in the airfoil tables.
 Dave modified error messages to direct the users to discussions on the NWTC Design Codes
   forums that describe the particular error/warning.
 Bonnie added FUNCTIONs IndexCharAry() and CROSS_PRODUCT() to NWTC_Num.f90.
  Marshall started to change WrOver() to use standard Fortran, but FLUSH doesn't seem to work, so he left it as
    it was and commented out the new stuff.
  Marshall added WaitTime() to NWTC_IO.
  Marshall changed CU from 7 to 6 in SysIVF.
  Marshall tried to replace "CALL FLUSH ( Unit )" with "FLUSH ( Unit )" in FlushOut() in SysIVF, which is a new standard
    Fortran 2003 statement, but there was a problem with ADAMS, so he commented out the changes.  We'll have to
    track that problem down.  We should also eventually eliminate FlushOut() altogether.

v1.03.01  2011-Jan-13  M. Buhl
 I fixed a bug in WrScr() that manifested itself in IVF v12 where we created a format with a
   "0X" in it.  We now have an IF that eliminates the skip if the indent is zero.

v1.04.00a-bjj, 6 Apr 2011, B. Jonkman
  I added FUNCTIONs EqualRealNos(), PathIsRelative() and ReadOutputList() and SUBROUTINE GetNewUnit() to NWTC_IO.f90
  I added an extra if statement to IndexCharAry() because it was missing the last value of the array.

  I fixed the logic in NWTC_IO.f90\GetRoot() so that a file named ".\wind\test" returns RootName = ".\wind\test"
    instead of RootName = "".

v1.04.00b-hs, 20 Apr 2011, H. Song (in progress)
  I added SUBROUTINE RombergInt to NWTC_Num.f90 .
  I updated the version number in NWTC_IO.f90 .

v1.04.00c-mlb, 2011-Jun-21  M. Buhl
  I added John Michalakes version of SysGnu.f90, but had to change the console file in OpenCon to 'CONOUT$'.
  I had to comment out the "USE NWTC_Library" from Huimin's RombergInt() routine in NWTC_Num.f90.
  I had to break a long line in two in Huimun's RombergInt().

v1.04.00d-bjj,  Dec 2011, B. Jonkman
  I added NWTC_SharedDataTypes.f90 to the archive. I hope to add a USE SharedDataTypes in MODULE NWTC_Library, but
    for now, I will wait until we update AeroDyn because it defines these same data types in MODULE SharedTypes

  I modified NWTC_Init() so that the ProgName and ProgVer variables are optional function paramters. This removes
    the need to set those variables separately in the calling program's code. I also write a message stating
    that the NWTC Subroutine Library {version number) is running. I removed the message in DispNDV() that states
    what version of the NWTC Subroutine Library is running so there won't be duplicate messages.

  I modified FlushOut() and FileSize() in SysIVF.f90 to explicitly use an INTEGER(4) in calls to FLUSH() and FSTAT()
    (per documentation of the FLUSH() and FSTAT() routines).

  I changed CU from 6 back to 7 in SysIVF.f90 because Adams (2011 in particular) crashes with opening the console using CU 6.
v1.04.00e-bjj, 15 Feb 2012 B. Jonkman
  I added R8Ki to the Precision module so that we have an 8-byte type that doesn't change between single (SingPrec.f90)
    and double precision (DoubPrec.f90).
  I removed alpha change comments.
  I added Num2LStr() as a generic INTERFACE for Int2LStr() and Flt2LStr().
  I modified SmllRotTrans() to optionally display an additional message when a warning first occurs.
  I updated WrScr() in Sys*.f90 to avoid errors when the string to write is blank (reported by Arnold Ramsland).

v1.04.00 16-Feb-2012 B. Jonkman
  I modified SysMatlab.f90 to fix issues with the WRITE() function in IVF 12.0.

v1.04.01 21-Feb-2012 B. Jonkman
  I added IMPLICIT NONE to NWTC_Num.f90 and fixed an error in the SmllRotTrans() message.

v1.04.02 27-Sep-2012 A. Platt
  I corrected the equation for CpminInt within the GetCoefs subroutine. The equation now uses the correct variables.

v1.05.00 24-Oct-2012 B. Jonkman (with help from A. Platt)
  I modified the InFile intent to INOUT in CheckArgs().
  I added IMPLICIT NONE to all of the modules where it was missing.
  I added IntKi and BytesPer* PARAMETERS to the Precision MODULE.
  I added the ProgDesc TYPE, AbortErrLev variable, and ErrID_* PARAMETERS to NWTC_IO
  I created new functions R2LStr4, R2LStr8, and R2LStr16 to replace Flt2LStr, particularly in the Num2LStr INTERFACE;
    new functions ReadR4Var, ReadR8Var, ReadR16Var replace ReadRVar in the ReadVar INTERFACE;
    new functions ReadRAryLines4, ReadRAryLines8, and ReadRAryLines16 replace ReadRAryLines in the ReadAryLines INTERFACE

  I removed subroutine InterpAF because it has never been used (and serves no purpose) See https://wind-dev.nrel.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=388
  I removed DoubPrecGnu.f90 from the archive because it is not necessary. gfortran (v4.6 and later) works with DoubPrec.f90.
  I removed SysVF.f90 from the archive, because it has been replaced with SysIVF.f90.
  I removed SysCVF.f90 because CVF is an old compiler that we want to discourage people from using.
  I removed NWTC_SharedDataTypes.f90 from the archive because it will not be necessary for the new framework.
  I removed subroutines/functions COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
    from SysIVF.f90, SysIFL.f90, and SysMatlab.f90 because they are part of the Fortran 2003 standard.
  I updated the OpenBinFile() and OpenBinInpFile() routines in SysIVF.f90 to use FORM='UNFORMATTED' , ACCESS='STREAM' instead of FORM='BINARY'.

  I added BufferRoutines.f90 to the archive for use with the FAST framework template.
  I added a placeholder for the ModMesh module (new FAST framework) and added ModMesh.f90 to the archive.

  I added constants called NaN, Inf, NaN_D, and Inf_D to store the IEEE values of NaN and Inf.
  I renamed the PiConst() subroutine to SetConstants() because we are using it set the NaN and Inf values, too.

  Andy Platt split the the SysGnu.f90 file into two, SysGnuLinux.f90 and SysGnuWin.f90. These are for the gfortran compiler on the respective
    platforms. The difference is in the unit number for the ConOut subroutine. The linux version should work with a mac as well.

  John Michalakes created a Makefile for the library, and I added it to the archive.
  I added the pdf with NWTC Library documentation to the archive.
  I modified the archive to also generate tar.gz files for non-windows users.

v1.05.01a-bjj 8-Nov-2012 B. Jonkman
  I replaced EqualRealNos with EqualRealNos4, EqualRealNos8, and EqualRealNos16 and made EqualRealNos an interface procedure.

v1.05.02a 4-Dec-2012 A. Platt
  I replaced DispNVD with DispNVD0 (no arguments), DispNVD1 (argument of type ProgDesc), and DispNVD2 (two string arguments).
  DispNVD is now an interface procedure.


v1.06.00a 26-Nov-2012  M. Buhl, B. Jonkman
   I added FASTdataType to the global types in NWTC_IO.f90 and also added ReadFASTbin() to it.
   Removed the unused IC declaration from Flt2LStr() in NWTC_IO.f90.
   I added UnIn to the argument list for ReadFASTbin().

   Bonnie added SysIVF_Labview.f90 to the archive and copied Marshall's changes to SysIVF.f90 to the other Sys*.f90 files.

v1.06.00b-bjj 7-Dec-2012  B. Jonkman
   I added a function called GetNVD() to return a single string with the program name, version, and date.

v1.06.00c-mlb  12-Dec-2012  M. Buhl
o  I added some comments to CheckArgs() in NWTC_IO.f90.
o  I redid the syntax output for CheckArgs() in NWTC_IO.f90 so it handled the situation where a *required* input file was omitted.
o  I added optional arguments (TimeWait and ErrLevel) to ProgAbort() in NWTC_IO.f90.  TimeWait determines
   whether to pause, proceed, or wait a specified amount of time before exiting the program.
   ErrLevel sets the error level reported to the OS if specified.  Otherwise, it uses 1.
o  I created ProgPause() in NWTC_IO.f90 to require the user to hit <Enter> to continue the program.
o  I created the system-specific parameter KBInputOK that is set to true if keyboard input is allowed.
o  I modified ProgAbort() to call ProgPause() only if KBInputOK is true.
o  I made all the global variables in the Sys* files parameters.
o  I changed all occurences of UnfForm being BINARY to UNFORMATTED in the Sys* files.
o  I did some simple clean-up and dosumentation in NWTC_IO.f90.
o  I added program Test_CheckArgs to the Source\Drivers folder to test the CheckArgs() routine in NWTC_IO.f90.

v1.07.00a-mlb, 08-Jan-2013  M. Buhl
o  Changes to SysGnuWin.f90
   o  I changed CU from 7 to 6 in the global-variables section.
   o  I removed LOGICAL FUNCTION KBInputOK().
   o  I removed all the executable statements from OpenCon and added a comment that it is unneeded for gfortran.
   o  I deleted FUNCTION UserTime() because that capability is now in the standard.
   o  I rewrote WrOver() so that it works with gfortran.
o  I created a test program, Test_OpenCon_GnuWin.f90, in Drivers to test OpenCon() with gfortran.
o  I added the subroutine NWTC_IO.f90\ChkRealFmtStr() to test the validity for
   strings to be used to generate formatted real numbers.
o  I created a test program, Test_ChkRealFmtStr.f90, in Drivers to test ChkRealFmtStr().
   I tested it with both IVF and gfortran on Windows.

v1.07.00b-mlb, 10-Jan-2013  M. Buhl
o  I modified NWTC_IO.f90\ReadFASTbin() to that one could read just the header.

v1.07.00c-bjj, 7-Feb-2013  B. Jonkman
o  I changed UnfForm from UNFORMATTED back to BINARY in the SysIVF.f90 file. TurbSim's .bin files weren't being properly written.

v1.07.01a-bjj, 25-Feb-2013  B. Jonkman
o  I modified WrOver() in SysGnuWin.f90. It previously produced a run-time error if the string being written was 98 characters or longer.

==========================================================
 To do:
   *** Add routines specifically for R8Ki, SiKi, and QuKi instead of ReKi and DbKi. (see ReadAry, etc.)

   Fix global variables so that only truly global data is stored there (to allow multiple instances running simultaneously)
   Fix ErrStat to use the new ErrID_* levels

   Create new read array routines that read an array from multiple lines.
   Fix NWTC_Aero.f90\AeroInt() to interpolate between control settings.

   Suggestion from Marshall:

      Add the optional UsrAlarm to ProgExit. (Requires moving BEEP from NWTC_IO)

      Are we going to add optional arguments to these kinds of routines to return
      to the calling routine with an error flag?

   o SysIVF.f90\OpenBinFile() has a RecLen argument that is not used.  Not sure how to deal with that.
