# OpenFAST python readers/writers

**IMPORTANT**: The `octue-openfast` package will eventually become `openfast` - don't rely on this PyPI package.

This python package has been ported over from [WEIS](https://github.com/WISDEM/WEIS/tree/77a878d7989b8c1d07d2244135ccd308a193a924/weis/aeroelasticse). It's 
a python wrapper comprising readers and writers for converting OpenFAST files to/from python objects.
