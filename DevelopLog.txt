v12.52a-mlb  17-Jan-2003  M. Buhl
 I added the ability to decimate the 4D wind grids.  I had to add three lines
 to the 4d paramater file, which necessitated adding logic to the ReadFDP()
 to read the new lines.  In that routine, I also modified the error messages
 to refer to the generic 4D wind instead of the specific LE wind.  I also
 renamed the parameter file to use the FDP extension instead of LEP, which
 required me to change CheckWindType().  I modified GetFDWind() and Read4DData()
 to use the number of decimated grid points.  I modified FD_Interp() to use
 the decimated arrays.  I added a bunch of new variables to FD_Wind() in
 AeroMods.f90.  After regenerating the binary 4D wind files, we now have to use
 different scales and offsets for each component.  This added six line to the
 parameter input file.  I added the variables to the FD_Wind() module, made
 ScalFact an array, and moved Offset from local storage to an array in the
 FD_Wind module.

v12.52a-mlb  24-Feb-2003  M. Buhl
 After much debugging and changing the way things work, I seem to have the 4D
 wind files working now.  I eliminated the Lbot input parameter because it was
 redundant with Lz.

v12.52b-mlb  24-Feb-2003  M. Buhl
 I added a header line and a time-values file name to the 4D wind parameter input file.
 I print the header line to the screen using a INFO call to the error log.
 I renumbered all the error numbers in ReadFDP().
 I added a time-file parameter to the 4D wind parameter input file.  It points to
  a file with the times for each wind file.  This allowed wind data with non-constant
  time steps.

v12.52c-mlb  03-Mar-2003  M. Buhl
 I added the logic to shift the elevation of the w-component data for 4D wind files.
  The input flag to allow it was added in an earlier version.
 I moved the norm variables from the module to FD_Interp(), where they are used exclusively.

v12.52c-mlb  05-Mar-2003  M. Buhl
 Neil wanted to specify the scaling velocity (ScaleVel) instead of the Nyquist frequency,
 so I had to change the input files, ReadFDP(), and GetFDWind().
 Because we are using just a portion of the original dataset in the z direction, we need
 to base the x and y scaling on the original Zm_max instead of the one that applies to
 the subset of the dataset.  This requires an extra input parameter.

v12.52c-mlb  06-Mar-2003  M. Buhl
 Neil decided that we should specify U0 instead of the Nyquist frequency, so I modified
 GetFDWind() and the FD_Wind module to deal with it.

v12.52d-mlb  07-Mar-2003  M. Buhl
 Maureen wants to be able to write her own wind routines, so I modified CheckWindType()
 to set the new UsrWndFlag flag when the input wind file name is "UserWind".  I put in
 calls to UserWind() in ADIN() and VWrel2G() when UsrWndFlag is true.
 I added appropriate WRITE statements to ADOut() fot the 4D and user-written winds.

v12.52f-mlb  21-Mar-2003  M. Buhl
 In aerosubs.f90\FD_Interp(), I have to put a MAX( value, 1 ) around the calculation
 of the lower indices for X and Y to prevent a possible value of zero.  This was already
 done for Z.

v12.52g-mlb  24-Mar-2003  M. Buhl
 I added to option to include the drag term in the equilibrium induction equations.
 One can now enter EQUILDA, EQUILDB, or EQUILDT for the inflow model.  For tangential
 induction, I could not firgure out how to modify the PROPX equations used, so I
 switched to the PROP-PC style equations when the drag term is included, but left
 the equation unchanged (using PROPX) when drag is not to be included.

v12.52h-mlb  26-Mar-2003  M. Buhl
 I decided I didn't like the idea of using a LOGICAL in a numerical expression, so
 I added a new variable (EqAIDmult) to the InducedVel module, which I then use in
 ADIN() and AXIND().  I set the value to 1 if we are to add the drag term to the axial-
 induction equation.  In AXIND(), I now use EqAIDmult instead of EquilDA in the equation.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: When using the Visual Fortran complier, one *must* add the
  following switch to the Project Options in the Project, Settings, Fortran tab
  if you want to use the 4D wind files:
     /assume:byterecl

v12.52a-djl 20-March-2003 D. Laino
 Added DynDebug subroutine in GDW routines.  It is commented out in the release
version.

v12.53a-jmj  28-Apr-2003  J. Jonkman
 I added a new module to AeroMods called Precision() that stores parameters to
   specify the KIND for variables.  I created the parameter ReKi and set it to
   4 to specify single precision for REAL variables.  I modified all REAL
   statements in all files to specify REAL(ReKi) so it would be easy to switch
   from single (4) to double (8) precision.  I also added the parameter DbKi
   for use instead of DOUBLE PRECISION statements, which are no longer allowed.
 I added the REAL() function around several lines of code and converted all
   SNGL() functions to REAL() functions so that the code does not crash when
   converting between single and double precision.
 To compile in double precision, change variable "ReKi", which is stored in
   MODULE AeroMods.f90/Precision(), to "8" and add the compile option
   "/real_size:64" (or "/4R8") to the project settings.  To revert back to
   single precision, change ReKi to 4 and remove the "/real_size:64" (or
   "/4R8") compile option.  As of yet, the double precision version only works
   with FAST and ADAMS.  I don't believe this will work with SymDyn or YawDyn.

v12.53b-jmj 06-Jun-2003  J. Jonkman
 I updated all CHARACTER*len variable declaration statements with modern
   CHARACTER(len) declarations.

v12.53 15-Jul-2003  D. Laino
 I commented out code being tested to handle GDW in low inflow conditions.  It
   will continue to be tested before possible release.

v12.57a-bjj 1-Jan-2004  B.Jonkman
 I added a new (C)oherent (T)urbulence module, CT_wind, based on the FD_wind module, and
   I added the LOGICAL variable CTWindFlag to the Switch module.  I modified  various
   subroutines and added a few more of them so that we can read this new format of TurbSim
   output. AeroDyn essentially adds two wind fields together when CTWindFlag is set (which
   occurs when it reads a coherent turbulence parameter ".ctp" input file).  It reads
   non-dimensional data, scales it, interpolates it, and then adds it to the interpolated
   background FF turbulence.
 In order for AeroDyn to correctly read these coherent turbulence files (which were generated
   on a Unix system), this code needs to be compiled with the "/assume:byterecl" option on the
   Compaq compiler.  This is also true for anyone wanting to use 4D wind files.
 There was a bug in subroutine ReadFF() that allowed binary SNWind files that were
   defined with clockwise rotation to be read in backwards. I modified the subroutine
   to fix that problem by being more general when reading input files, and I updated (most of)
   the older-style programming in this subroutine in the process. I also modified the
   subroutine to look for rectangular grids that do not have hub height in the center.
   These modifications allow AeroDyn to read grids produced by the new program, TurbSim.
 I fixed a minor bug that would allow some non-square BLADED full-field wind files to use
   grids that are potentially too small (where the distance from the hub to the top of the
   wind field is less than 110% of the rotor radius) without producing a warning.  The
   variable ZGOffset wasn't initialized before the subroutine READ_Bladed_FF() used it to
   make this check.

v12.57b-bjj 1-Jan-2004 B. Jonkman
 I added a little feature that will output wind velocities at each blade element. Typing
   "WIND" at the end of the line in the AD input file that defines each element will result
   in that element's wind speeds being printed to a file named "*.wind" (It basically works
   like the PRINT/NOPRINT option.)  This change is not documented in the AeroDyn User's Guide.

v12.57c-bjj 19-Apr-2004  B.Jonkman
 I made the following modifications to AeroSubs.f90 and GenSubs.f90 to fix most of the
   non-standard code: I replaced the tabs in the code with spaces. I shortened the lines
   that exceeded the standard right hand column by splitting them into two or more lines.
   I made the arguments to intrinsic functions MAX() and MIN() the same data type with
   the same KIND parameters.

v12.57d-bjj 21-Jun-2004 B. Jonkman
 I modified subroutine ReadFF in AeroSubs.f90 to read TurbSim output in the "New" BLADED
   format (using the TurbSim summary file instead of a Bladed summary file).

v12.57e-bjj 28-Jun-2004 B. Jonkman
 We found a bug in the scaling of the height, width, and time scales in the 4D wind files.
   I modified the subroutine GetFDWind() to fix the problem.  The ".fdp" input files also
   need to have variables Xm_max, Ym_max, and Zm_max modified.  We no longer use Zm_maxo to
   scale anything, but I left it in the input file since there are several other un-used
   variables in there already.

v12.57f-bjj 13-July-2004 B. Jonkman
 I made slight changes to the coherent turbulence parameter file (*.ctp file).

v12.57g-bjj 9-Aug-2004 B. Jonkman
 I added some parameters to the 4D wind files so that we can accommodate DNS data files
   which we shift in x to perform a change in time. The 4d input files now need an extra
   couple of parameters in order to perform the advection correctly.  I had to modify
   subroutines GetFDWind(), Read4DData(), ReadFDP(), and FD_Interp() to achieve this
   change.

v12.57h-bjj 9-Sept-2004 B. Jonkman
 I added some logic in the CTWind subroutines to enable TurbSim to use DNS event files.
   I also fixed a bug in the calculation of the time shift for CTWind files.

v12.70a  Aug 2009 B. Jonkman
 I removed the subroutines that deal with getting the wind speed at a particular
   point in time and space from AeroSubs.f90 and placed them in a file called
   AeroWindSubs.f90.
 I added INTENT() attributes to all the passed parameters in AeroSubs.f90
 I put the AeroDyn subroutines in a module and the AeroWindSubs in another module.
   I had to update the CheckWindType() subroutine in because IN/OUT character arguments
   need to be TRIMmed inside the subroutine, not in the function argument.
 I replaced variable DtoR with D2R and variable RtoD with R2D (for NWTC_Library later).
 I added a AeroDyn_Terminate() function to clean up variables and close files,
   which is important when linking with other codes, particularly Matlab/Simulink.
 I added INTENT() to the passed parameters to help determine the data flow.

v12.70b  Sep 2009 B. Jonkman
 I started adding the NWTC Library v1.01.09: I replaced all calls to Abort()
   with ProgAbort(). I replaced all calls to WriteScreen() with WrScr(). I
   replaced all calls to OpenInFile() with OpenFInpFile(). I replaced all the
   LOGICAL(1) declarations with LOGICAL.
 I added "IF (.not. allocated(xxx))" to allocation statements throughout AeroDyn.
 I replaced all of the ErrLog calls with calls to ProgAbort(), ProgWarn(), or
   WrScr() as appropriate. I removed the warnings if the FF grid is "too large"
   because I think that's just silly.
 I'm removing the GridHeight and GridWidth (and consequently RDiam) from the
   Read of the FF summary file.  These values can be retreived from the binary
   file (and are only used for checking vs rotor size anyway).
 I replaced the wind inflow routines with a new module:
   I changed the HH files to be read in at the beginning of the simulation. I
     thought about changing the definition of the direction to be ccw looking from
     above, which is the opposite of the previous direction. However, there is
     some concern that the met people will get confused and people will also have
     to change existing files. We talked about adding another wind type that works
     like HH but has actual basis functions. In it, we can define direction like math people. ;-)
   When compiling A2AD--compiled as a dll using CVF--with the new inflow routines,
     using the NWTC_Library's AllocAry() subroutine to allocate global arrays caused
     some issues.  For instance when I did this:
                           A = B
                           print *, A, B
     A and B were 2 different numbers! I replaced the call to AllocAry() with the
     ALLOCATE statement and corresponding checks and all worked fine.
   I added a check in the FD wind files so that if we move backward in time, the
     wind speeds are calculated correctly.  Before, the wind would remain
     constant until you'd passed the previous time step.
   Heights are now relative to the ground, NOT the hub height. (though the HH
     files do still have a reference height).
   The TurbSim .bts and .twr files can now be read. The .twr files will always
     be read if they correspond to the binary FF file you are reading.
   UserWind is now a self-contained module, not just a subroutine.
   I fixed some minor issues with the FF grids. The last time step will be read
     if there are an odd number of time steps in the file (previously it was
     skipped). I also added some space for numerical rounding issues so that it
     doesn't produce an error at the outer grid points.
   The UNITS flag has been removed--all wind speeds must be returned in m/s.
   The module does not abort, but returns an error flag. The calling program
     must decide how to handle that.
   The wind inflow summary information is not contained in AeroDyn's .opt file
     any more.
 I removed the LOCATE function from AeroDyn and added a subroutine with similar
   functionality in NWTC library.
 I added a check so that if AeroDyn tries to use English units, it stops.
 I removed references to XGrnd, YGrnd, and ZGrnd.  As far as I can tell, the
   position is only used to get wind speeds at the correct location.  That
   position is now an input array for the desired subroutine.
 I replaced message refering to "aerodyn.ipt" because that is not necessarially
   the name of the AeroDyn input file.
 I added the tower influce model that Pat Moriarty added in another version of
   AeroDyn. We don't want to change the input file until later, when we've decided
   the new format, so I left it as a hidden feature. Note that the tower influence
   (both Pat's version and the old one) does not currently move with the tower.
   It assumes the tower is in the undeflected initial position!
   To use the hidden feature,

--------------------------- AeroDyn v13. --------------------------------------
----- PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS VERSION (13.00.00) IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE! ----
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v13.00.00a-bjj 31-Mar-2010 B. and J. Jonkman
 We implemented a new AeroDyn-structural codes interface by adding the AeroDyn.f90
   source file. Ideally, the public subroutines contained in it will be the only
   way structural codes will access any part of AeroDyn... for now, we still have
   some work to do before that happens. The AD_init() subroutine replaces
   calls to SetProgName() and AD_InputGate(). The AD_CalculateLoads() function
   replaces AeroFrcIntrface(), GetRotorParams(), GetBladeParams(), GetElemParams(),
   and GetVNVT(). It is called once per time step, with the positions,
   orientations, and velocities for all elements passed at one time.

v13.00.01a-bjj 25-Jan-2012 B. Jonkman
 When file names in the input file are relative (not absolute), they are now relative
   to the directory containing the input file (not the current working directory).
 I fixed some instances where the lines in the code exceeded 132 characters.
 I modified some error messages to indicate where the error occurred.
 I modified AeroMods.f90 and AeroSubs.f90 to use default INTEGER kinds instead of INTEGER(4).
 I updated the AP(J,I) array in SUBROUTINE VindInf(). Previously, a local A2P variable was set,
   but the output was not. Thus, AP was always zero when SWIRL and DYNIN were used. (this bug
   was reported on the forums by Qiang Liu). I also initialize the A() and AP() arrays because I
   do not believe they were always properly set. (some of the IF statements didn't change the
   values of these arrays before saving them in the output array).  If the /Qzero option was
   enabled during compilation, this change does not effect any results except that the
   tangential induction is now properly output in the element output file.

v13.00.01b-bjj, 28-Aug-2012 B. Jonkman
 I removed the ProgDesc type from SharedTypes.f90 and placed it in the NWTC Library.
