SubDyn Change Log
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.01.00a-rrd     30-Jun-2014
	Official FAST 8.08 public release
- added checks that NMOutputs <= 9 and that NOutCnt must be >= 1 and <= minimim(Ndiv+1,9)
- Removed one unneeded comment
- Updated copyright notices
- fixed issue with x64 builds where DoubPrec.f90 should be excluded.
- added a warning if gravity is input as a negative number in SD_Init()
- updated SD input file for 1bayOC4
- updated NWTC Library & NetLib dependencies
- fixed some formatting in SD_FEM so it is easier to read the code.
- removed TODO comments that were addressed
- Updated the input file format and associated file parsing code.
- updated NWTC library version
- modified SubDyn's arguments to NWTC_LAPACK routines based on modifications in NWTC_LAPACK.f90
- cleaned up Visual Studio project file
- added option to choose nmodes = 0
- Summary file cleanup.
- removed some matrices from standard release summary file (they are still available if compiled with SD_SUMMARY_DEBUG preprocessor definition). 
- Added column to summary file node table indicating which node in the Y2 mesh it is.
- replaced matrix inverses with factored matrices and calls to *GETRS() [solves]; this should be more numerically sound (and it got rid of memory issue Inspector complained about)
- added a SQRT on the eigenvalues inside EigenSolve (this is for consistency; before this, the SQRT was taken outside the routine and somewhat confusing to debug)
- reorganized SD_CalcOutput so that it calculates all the U and y block matrices in one place and puts them into the meshes in another place
- replaced ReduceKMdofs with a new routine that doesn't use WHERE or NaN. Renamed the old routine ReduceKMdofs_Old and left it there until we're confident it can be removed
- added ConstructUFL() routine so that we don't have to replicate that 4 times in the code
- made a small change to AM2 so that we calculate B*(U_n+1+u_n) instead of B*U_n+1 + B*U_n
- replaced OtherState%y2 and %U_dotdot with %UR_bar, %UL, %UR_bar_dot, %UL_dot, %UR_bar_dotdot, and %UL_dotdot because (1) that's how the variables are used in the code and (2) it's easier to read (I don't have to check the y2 subscripts all the time)
- added comments and references to equations in Theory Guide
- updated NWTC library
- removed old commented-out code
- removed more unused variables
- Updated code to eliminate multiple writes to the SD output file for the same time stamp.
- Moved the local Decimate var to OtherStates
- fixed bug where reaction loads were not calculated if reaction channels were specified in the input file without starting with case-specific "React" (i.e., different case or negative values). The output was a random number.
- Replaced diagonal matrices A_21 and A_22 with arrays representing their diagonal values, renamed to indicate the values stored in them (NOmegaM2, and NOmegaJDamp).
- Replaced B_24 with PhiM_T (transpose of PhiM)
- Replaced C2_21 and C_42 with PhiM 
- Replaced D2_11, D2_32, and D2_53 with TI
- Replaced D2_21 and D2_42 with PhiRb_TI
- removed OutJctF from registry because it was unused
- replaced multiplying diagonal matrices--now stored as arrays--by multiplication of the individual array values (equivalent to matlab's .* operator)
- replaced KLL_Inv with solve of KLL * PhiR = -KLR (should be more accurate and use less memory)
- replaced Character(1024) with character(*) on every variable that has an INTENT() attribute.
- fixed setting of p%qml, which was moved incorrectly just before I committed last time. oops. also fixed lines that headers/units are in.
- I added a factor of 1/2 (now 1/12 instead of 1/6) back in the ElemG routine; this is logically equivallent to what Rick had previously, though it uses fewer calculations to get there, so hopefully is less prone to numerical problems.
- I added LumpForces back, along with the comment that it's intended to be used in the future.
- I added NINT() around several more integers stored in the first column of real arrays. Hopefully I got them all now.
- I found a problem with the single-precision LAPACK sggev routine, which gave wildly different eigenvectors in debug versus release mode. I replaced it with a call to dggev, and it seems to work a lot better.
- I fixed a bug where the MemberID needed to be stored sequentially, starting at 1.
- I created a SD_InitType, leaving only the variables set in the glue code in SD_InitInputType. This allowed me to make SD_InitInputType INTENT(IN), and helps me see what gets set in SD versus FAST/driver.
- I removed some variables previously stored and initialized in the SD registry-generated types and made the PARAMETERS at the top of SD_FEM.f90. (These are things like the number of columns being read from the input file, etc.)
- I moved the CB_MatArrays and FEM_MatArrays to the Registry so that I could call the auto-generated destroy routines at the end of the SD_Init routine.
- I fixed a bunch of error handling.
- I moved a lot of the allocation statements so that it was easier for me to read.
- I removed some old commented-out code, unnecessary variables, and some unused arguments.
- I've been editing the Registry in an Excel spreadsheet to help me better see what's defined where. SO, the Registry.txt file looks a lot different. 
- fixed a bug in GetDirCos, which would cause the direction cosine matrix to not be orthonormal in certain cases (not sure it was ever triggered)
- cleaned up GetDirCos (removed old method, which was being calculated then overwritten with new stuff)
- with help from jmj: fixed a bug in ElemG, which caused the lumped moments to be incorrect. Also added comments in the routine.
- removed LumpForces() because it wasn't being called and it looked like it had the same bug ElemG had in it. 
- modified UnReduceVRdofs so VR/Phi is intent INOUT (instead of copying the matrix)
- updated NWTC Library routines (also modified this version of NWTC_LAPACK to generate some errors when things aren't the correct sizes)
- removed SD_OutVar_Type from registry and replaced it with the identical OutParmType from NWTC Library.
- modified driver so that sd input file name is relative to location of driver file
- removed some more unused code 
- updated error handling on read of SD input file 
- made sure derived types were allocated and destroyed in the update states integration calls (ABM4, etc)
- replaced some unnecessary local copies of variables
- renamed NPE in SD_Discrt to NNE to be consistent with other routines
- improved QSortC so that the second dimension of the matrix doesn't have to be size 2
- changed some ReKis initialized as "0" to "0.0" (only to remove compiler warnings for benign reasons)
- removed some unused variables
- added makefile for driver using gfortran
- fixed problem with length of ipiv for calculation of inverse when AM2 option was used
- removed p%TI as an argument to SetParameters because p is also an argument (intent(INOUT)). It was probably okay because p%TI wasn't changed there, but I don't know what the compiler would do if you DID change it.
- updated NWTC Library, which caused the problem with strange eigenvalues to go away.
- added dependencies folder for compiling
- added compiling folder
- modified input file to reflect recent changes in code (renamed outputs, added SttcSolve line, changes 0.0 timestep to "default")
- fixed bug in the static improvement for phiL_T which is now added to the mix
- Mu had not been re-dimensioned appropriately. Fixed.
- fixed spelling for outsummary
- types and registry updated
- D2_53 and D2_64 had a wrong allocation, now it is fixed.
-  added quotes around comments in registry input file
- called Copy routines in AB4 instead of using = on allocatable arrays (gfortran will not like the = sign)
- regenerated types file
- Have replaced Cbar, Dbar, and Fbar matrices with C2,D2,F2 new subterms, to comply with the new Y2 equation which has all of the terms.
- Updated script to work with SubDyn
- Updated so that it works with Matlab script
- Updated output channel data using the copy/paste from Matlab generated data.
- Updated some comments with Rick, removed some unused variables.
- Fixed units for output channel labels
- Fixed Jason's request for qmdotdot into calc_output rather than update_states, also changed names to INterface and Reaction forces.
- I modified the module to use our new FAST output file naming convention: <RootName>.<ModName>.<ext> (you may want to test if it works as expected for the driver code)
- I modified UpdateStates to use the ExtrapInterp routine instead of assuming input(1) was the value associated with time t (though this may all need to be moved to CalcOutput?)
- I initialize states and inputs in RK4 using the copy routines (so gfortran won't seg fault there) and destroy the values at the end of the routine.... this will have to be done in the other integrator routines, too.
- I added a check for division by zero when we calculate the eigenvalues from LAPACK_ggev. I think the error I was getting was caused by other issues (that I think are fixed), but it doesn't hurt to keep this check in there.
- JDampings treatment updated, so that you can use any number of Jdampings <= Nmodes for CBMod=True.  Note For CBMOD=FALSE only one value is allowed .
- Moved x%qmdotdot to OtherStates
- Added input file parameter SttcSolve
- Changed implementation of SDdeltaT parameter to work with DEFAULT instead of 0.0
- The summary file was ouputting sqrt(sqrt(omegam^2))/(2 pi) instead of (sqrt(omegaM^2))/(2 pi). The reason is a copy and paste from the FEM Omega print-out was not changed, and it was not checked properly against real data.This is now fixed.
- I changed some ErrStat checks to compare with ErrID_None instead of 0
- I pass the entire program description type to SDOut() [gfortran didn't like the mismatch in sizes of the characters being passed; I just decided to pass the whole type and print the version number in the output file, too]
- I removed some unused variables and extra (duplicated) "USE NWTC_Library", "USE SubDyn_Types", and "IMPLICIT NONE" statements
- Fixed TempProps to Init%Props assignment for NDIV=1
- Removed commented out lines, adjusted code spacing/alignment of text
- Changed _SubDyn.out to _SD.out
- I replaced calls to LAPACK and ScaLAPACK routines with calls to wrapper routines found here: https://windsvn.nrel.gov/FAST/branches/BJonkman/Source/dependencies/NetLib
- I removed DLASRT2.f90 (moved to source/old) because it was replaced in above external library.
- I put NINT() around reals used as integers.
- I updated some of the error handling in SD_Init. We should check the places where it checks IF (ErrStat > ErrID_Warn) and consider replacing it with IF (ErrStat >= AbortErrLev) instead.
- I updated more of the code to use explicit type casting (instead of implicit)
- Modified Reactions for both INterface and Restraints, adding Hydrodynamic forces.
- Renumbered the p%React which was left out before so that the overall node renumbering works (ID vs positional numer.
- Fixed a few hanging pieces of code that were not being used.
- Mu and Mu2 variables were declared as DOFLxDOFL instead of DOFMxDOFM, fixed now
- added indexing change due to the additional mesh nodes
- Fixed indexing into Lmesh in AM2 and calccontstatederiv
- NEW RESULTS FROM ANSYS in ANSYS_SUBDYN_RESULTS.docx
- Changed DIRCOS in outsummary, not a big a deal, but now it is clear and consistent on what it is.
- fixed indexing problem with:
  Allouts(SSqm01  :SSqm01  +maxOutModes-1) = x%qm      (1:maxOutModes)
  Allouts(SSqmd01 :SSqmd01 +maxOutModes-1) = x%qmdot   (1:maxOutModes)
  Allouts(SSqmdd01:SSqmdd01+maxOutModes-1) = x%qmdotdot(1:maxOutModes)
  we now limit the number of output modes to 99.
- New Cert Test Folder
- Updated for WtrDpth init input from driver.
- altered indexing in CalcOutput for interior nodes
- changed indexing in BrkSysMtrx to DOFC
- minor bug fixed in accelerations and comments, also removed IDRbarL
- merging Greg's modifications with mine....
- Added Interface and Constrained nodes to Y2Mesh and LMesh
- added some comments to it plus started the treatment with NNodesC
- started working on adding restraint nodes to Y2 mesh
- Y2 mesh expanded to contain interface nodes.
- Fixed a bug with the acceleration and how they were used.
- clean up of some comments
- acceleration put in the meshes y2mesh
- Added calls to copy temporary input type before using it in SD_Input_ExtrapInterp() and to destroy it after it's used. SD_Input_ExtrapInterp doesn't allocate any arrays or meshes, so you have to make sure they are set first.
- Commented out a debug section.
- This new version contains fixes to the summary file for TI(being written with the correct format) . Also fixes to the order of the CB matrices in terms of constraint DOFs (first) and Interface DOFs (second). THis seems to offer better results in the end.
  Also, the KBBt and MBBt are more symmetric.  Compiling everything in Double Precision and using double-version of the inversion and eigenvalue functions, leads to an even better resolution for the KBBt and MBBt in the end, with some 10 orders of magnitude difference in the "minor" terms.  Running everything in single precision is not that accurate, but perhaps still good enough. Those two matrices are not quite symmetric in single precision, and better in double as well.
- Modifications to init set parameters and AM2 to account for linearity of the system. Results are more or less consistent with RK4 for now.
- Added a new integrator Adams Boulton of 2nd order -implicit.  Perhaps to complete with a Newton integrator. FOr now simple iteration converges. Also added full FEM modes to the summary file.

v0.04.00a-rrd     03-October-2013
    Official FAST 8.x public release
      Limitations
      1.	Tight coupling is not yet supported.
      2.	Only limited error checking of user’s input is implemented.  Carefully examine the input file if unexpected errors are found.
      3.	Limited restraint capabilities are available (only clamped nodes allowed).
      4.	Only nontapered Euler-Bernoulli (E-B) or a 2-node Timoshenko (T) element formulations are available (in the future, tapered E-B and tapered T will be implemented).
      5.	Only circular members are permitted (in the future, a generic cross-section will be allowed).
      6.	Reaction loads are calculated at (0,0,-Wdepth) substructure (SS) reference frame (e.g., sea-bed level); in the future, a reference location will be user input.
      7.	The number of elements per member (NDiv) is constant throughout the structure.
      8.	The code has not yet been coupled with HydroDyn.
      9.	Limited testing has been conducted; use caution in interpreting the results and try different numbers of retained modes to ensure convergence of the results if using CBMod.
      10.	Internal matrices are not stored in sparse form, limiting the total number of possible nodes/degrees of freedom (DOF)/finite elements to about 300/1800.
      11.	Foundation (soil-structure interaction) modeling is not yet available.
      12.	The dynamics system reduction is performed in the absence of external loading.
      13.	Gravitational loading does not impact the global substructure stiffness.
      14.	Loads (gravitational, inertial, hydrodynamic) can only be applied as concentrated loads at element nodes; distributed loads (per unit length) are not yet supported.
      15.	Compiling requires the Intel Math Kernel Library (gfortran is not yet supported). Note that IMKL routines used in this release are publicly available LAPACK routines at http://www.netlib.org/lapack .
