SUBROUTINE CalcSteady


   ! CalcSteady is used to march in time until a periodic steady state
   !   solution (if rotor is spinning) or static equilibrium (if rotor
   !   is parked) is found via a simple tolerance check.  Once found
   !   the periodic solution is interpolated to find the periodic
   !   operating point displacements, velocities, and accelerations of
   !   each DOF at each of the equally-spaced azimuth steps.

Gain for artificially increasing the damping for the blades, tower, and drivetrain to aid in convergence (used during all steady state solution calculations).  !JASON: This didn't improve the convergence times much and, in fact, made the solution more unstable.  Thus, I disabled this by setting the gain to zero.
KYawPos  = 0.1                         ! Gain (in rad) for adjusting the nacelle yaw command          from the relative rotor speed error (used with TrimCase = 3).
KGenTrq  = 1.5*AvgNrmTpRd**3/GBRatio   ! Gain (in N-m) for adjusting the electrical generator torque  from the relative rotor speed error (used with TrimCase = 2).  The rated rotor torque of a typical wind turbine in N-m is roughly 15*Radius^3 where the radius is in meters.  The 1.5 is 1/10th of the factor of 15.  The 1/GBRatio is used to cast the torque onto the HSS (i.e., generator) side of the gearbox.  (Nm)
KBlPitch = 0.1                         ! Gain (in rad) for adjusting the rotor collective blade pitch from the relative rotor speed error (used with TrimCase = 3).


   ! If trimming electrical generator torque, let's override the generator
   !   torque models calculated in SUBROUTINE DrvTrTrq().  The trimmed torque
   !   value is determined with VSContrl = 9999.
   ! Also, let's specify a starting "guess" value for the generator torque:

IF ( ( GenDOF ) .AND. ( TrimCase == 2 ) )  THEN ! We will be trimming generator torque

   VSContrl = 9999   ! Override the selected VSContrl and GenModel input options
   GenTrq   = 0.0    ! Use a defult generator torque of zero--I found that if I guessed high on the initial generator torque, the results were very unstable; but if I started at zero, the solution always converged.

! NOTE: This method of specifying the default generator torque using the intial
!       aerodynamic torque (converted to the generator end of the drivetrain),
!       did not work:
!   !   This default generator torque is determined by calling RtHS once (with
!   !   initial conditions) and estimating the generator torque from the
!   !   aerodynamic torque given in vector, MomLPRott.
!   !   NOTE: Using this method requires the USE of MODULE RtHndSid() and
!   !         declaration of global function, DotProd:
!   GenTrq = 0.0      ! Define a dummy generator torque
!   QT  = Q (:,IC(1)) ! Use initial conditions
!   QDT = QD(:,IC(1)) ! for the DOFs
!   CALL RtHS         ! Call the dynamics routine once
!   GenTrq = DotProd( MomLPRott, e1 )*GBoxEffFac/GBRatio ! Convert the aerodynamic torque to the HSS-side

   !   that it moves forward then backward slightly, then forward then backward
   !   slightly, etc... (i.e., the whole 2 step forward, 1 step backward dance
   !   move).  If this is so, it is impossible to find unique periodic
   !   operating states of each DOF since there will are multiple operating
   !   states at each azimuth step.  To ensure the monotonically increasing
   !   condition, the zero to TwoPi constraint is not enforced during this
   !   algorithm and the rotor azimth is checked at each time step to make sure
   !   it has monotonically increased.  To ensure the monotonically increasing

As Karl Stol pointed out when developing SymDyn, the iteration for the induction factor in AeroDyn starts from the previous states of the induction factors for each element.  Thus, he has found that he gets better convergence when he calls AeroDyn multiple times for each time step.  He currently implements 4 loops when he linearizes his model.  Is this necessary in FAST as well?  This can be checked by iterating RtHS 4 times every time you perturb a DOF in Linearize()--then see if the state matrices change!!!!!  I am using the IterRtHS PARAMETER set to 4 to match SymDyn.
