C Original date 13 September 1999
C 01/11/00  Entries in IW initialized to zero in MA57O/OD to avoid copy
C           of unassigned variables by MA57E/ED.
C           AINPUT and IINPUT reset in call to MA57E/ED.
C 06/02/01  Default values for ICNTL(12) and ICNTL(13) changed.
C           Control for direct addressing in solve changed to be
C           on number of rows and number columns in block pivot.
C           Several comments changed as consequence.
C           INFO(31) added to record number of block pivots.
C           Subroutines MA57X/XD and MA57Y/YD added for efficiency when
C           only one rhs (equivalent to MA57Q/QD and MA57R/RD resp).
C 04/07/01  Use of MC41 changed to use of MC71.
C 26/10/01  Printing controls corrected to ensure ICNTL(5) is used and
C           unit number always checked for being positive before
C           printing. Text and comments changed to reflect that D
C           inverse is held in factors and text for solution changed
C           from Right-hand side to solution.
C           Option of choosing two 1 x 1 pivots when 2 x 2 fails
C           removed.
C           MC47B/BD given remaining length in KEEP to avoid compresses
C 20/12/01  INFO(1) initialized to zero in MA57E/ED
C 06/12/02  The test for convergence of iterative refinement changed to
C           avoid any problem with comparisons of numbers held in
C           registers.
C 25/03/03  MC50 (AMD with dense row protection) and MA27 (minimum
C           degree) added. Invoked by ICNTL(6) equal to 2 and 3,
C           respectively. Routines MA57H/HD, MA57V/VD, and MA57Z/ZD
C           have been added to duplicate routines MA27H/HD, MA27G/GD,
C           and MA27U/UD from MA57 and MC50B/BD is another internal
C           routine of MA57. ICNTL(14) has been added to control
C           density of rows regarded as dense by the MC50 and MA27
C           orderings.
C 24/05/04  Statement functions in MA57U/UD replaced by in-line code.

C 12th July 2004 Version 1.0.0. Version numbering added.

C 20/07/04  Several changes incorporated for HSL 2004 code.
C           Removed unused INT,ABS from MA57U/UD
C           INFO(32), INFO(33), and INFO(34) added
C           INFO(32): no. of zeros in the triangle of the factors
C           INFO(33): no. of zeros in the rectangle of the factors
C           INFO(34): no. of zero columns in rectangle of the factors
C           Static pivoting available (controlled by CNTL(4), CNTL(5))
C           Scaling using symmetrized MC64 (ICNTL(15))
C           Links to METIS_NODEND ordering


C 31st July 2004 Version 2.0.0 established at HSL 2004 release.

C 1st Sept  2004 Version 2.1.0. Default changed to static pivoting off.
C 10th Sept 2004 Version 2.2.0. Defaults for ICNTL(6), ICNTL(9) and
C           CNTL(5) changed. Scaling factors (optionally) printed.
C  4th Nov  2004 Version 2.2.1. Change to assembly of reals in MA57O/OD
C           leading to more efficient code at suggestion of Stephane
C           Pralet.
C 13th Dec  2004 Version 2.3.0. Several minor changes after field
C           testing.
C           Scale factors (RINFO(16) and RINFO(17) set to 1
C           if scaling not used.
C           Option to handle dense columns invoked for METIS ordering.
C           Value of SCHNAB(1) set to 1. to allow Schnabel-Eskow to
C           work on matrix with a rows of zeros.
C           Some diagnostic printing and STOP statements removed from
C           MC50.

C 2nd March 2005  Version 3.0.0.  A new option has been added for
C           ordering the matrix.  If ICNTL(6) is equal to 5 then the
C           ordering chosen depends on the matrix characteristics.
C           At the moment the choices are MC50 or METIS.
C           INFO(36) is set to ordering used.
C           A minor change has been made to the pivot control to reduce
C           the amount of researching on failed pivots (resetting of
C           KR). FD05 dependence changed to FD15.
C 15th June 2005  Version 3.0.1.  Setting of ALENB in MA57B/BD moved
C           before first error exit to avoid undefined variable
C           if error invoked.  INFO(1) initialized to zero in call to
C           MA57C/CD.
C 1 December 2006. Version 3.0.2. Comments adjusted to meet the
C           72-character limit.

C 3 August 2007  Version 3.1.0.
C           The new version of MC47 (that incorporates an updated
C           version of MC50 is used).

C 19 September 2007  Version 3.2.0
C           New option added (ICNTL(16)) that allows the removal of
C           blocks of small entries to the end of the factorization.
C           Is particularly powerful when matrix is severely rank
C           deficient.  Numerous other mainly cosmetic changes that
C           don't affect interface.

C  3 September  2009 Version 3.3.0
C           Some typos corrected in comments.
C           Length given to array IW in MA57K/KD (called from MA57A/AD
C           as IKEEP(IFCT)) increased to avoid problem when order
C           of matrix is greater than number of entries.
C           Value of dropping control (ICNTL(16)) is now printed
C           on entry to MA57B/BD.
C           Bug in ordering from MA27 corrected in MA57H/HD (was
C           previously identical to MA27H/HD).
C           Test now made to check space if less than N pivots are
C           chosen at end of MA57O/OD whatever the reason (previously
C           was only done if ICNTL(16) was equal to 1).
C           INFO/RINFO parameters now all initialized to zero on
C           entry to MA57O/OD so that they have a valid value in the
C           case of an error return.
