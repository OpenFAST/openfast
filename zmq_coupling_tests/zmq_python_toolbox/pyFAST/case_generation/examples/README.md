This folder contains examples of OpenFAST postprocessing:

- CPLambdaPitch: determine the CP-CT Lambda Pitch matrices of a turbine.
- ExcelFile: Generate, run and postprocess OpenFAST cases using an Excelfile which defines the parameters to change for each simulation
- ParametricStudy: Generate, run and postprocess OpenFAST simulations where the parameters of each cases are defined within a python loop
- PowerCurve: run a set of OpenFAST simulations to determine a power curve.
