This directory contains different working examples to work with the linearization package and the linearization file outputs of OpenFAST.


Examples using low-level functions:

- `ex1a_OneLinFile_SimpleEigenAnalysis.py`: read a .lin file, extract the A matrix, and perform and eigenvalue analysis 
- `ex1b_OneLinFile_NoRotation.py`: post-process one linearization file from OpenFAST (still using the MBC). 


Examples using higher-level functions:

- `ex3a_MultiLinFile_Campbell.py`: Script to to post-process several linearization files generated by different OpenFAST simulations.

- `runCampbell.py`: Generates a Campbell diagram; write OpenFAST input files, run openfast, postprocess the linearization files, and generate the Campbell diagram plot. Requires an openfast executable.
