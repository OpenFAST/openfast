This folder contains examples of OpenFAST postprocessing:

- RadialInterp: interpolate a timeseries to a given radial location based on OpenFAST radial node outputs.
- RadialPostPro: extract average OpenFAST outputs as function of the radial coordinates
- Remap: remap a dataframe: change names, and perform operations (e.g. change units, scale, combine signals)
- TurbSim\_Processing: read a TurbSim input file, modify it, run TurbSim, and open the output file.
- TurbSimBox: read a TurbSim Box, extract some data, plot them, fit a power law, modify the box, write it to disk, write time series at given locations to a CSV file
- VTKPlanesGrid: Reads a VTK file containing a velocity Grid/Plane. The format is typically used as inputs/outputs of FAST.Farm or outputs of OLAF.
