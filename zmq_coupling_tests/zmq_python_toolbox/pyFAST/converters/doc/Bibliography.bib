  abstract = {Because of its versatility in analyzing a broad range of applications, multibody dynamics has grown in the past two decades to be an important tool for designing, prototyping, and simulating complex articulated mechanical systems. This textbook-a result of the author's many years of research and teaching-brings together diverse concepts of dynamics, combining the efforts of many researchers in the field of mechanics. Bridging the gap between dynamics and engineering applications such as microrobotics, virtual reality simulation of interactive mechanical systems, nanomechanics, flexible biosystems, crash simulation, and biomechanics, the book puts into perspective the importance of modeling in the dynamic simulation and solution of problems in these fields. To help engineering students and practicing engineers understand the rigid-body dynamics concepts needed for the book, the author presents a compiled overview of particle dynamics and Newton's second law of motion in the first chapter. A particular strength of the work is its use of matrices to generate kinematic coefficients associated with the formulation of the governing equations of motion. Additional features of the book include: * numerous worked examples at the end of each section * introduction of boundary-element methods (BEM) in the description of flexible systems * up-to-date solution techniques for rigid and flexible multibody dynamics using finite- element methods (FEM) * inclusion of MATLAB-based simulations and graphical solutions * in-depth presentation of constrained systems * presentation of the general form of equations of motion ready for computer implementation * two unique chapters on stability and linearization of the equations of motion Junior/senior undergraduates and first-year graduate engineering students taking a course in dynamics, physics, control, robotics, or biomechanics will find this a useful book with a strong computer orientation towards the subject. The work may also be used as a slf-study resource or research reference for practitioners in the above-mentioned fields. © 2006 Birkhäuser Boston.},

  abstract = {The finite element absolute nodal coordinate formulation is used in this investigation to study the centrifugal stiffening effect on rotating two-dimensional beams. It is demonstrated that the geometric stiffening effect can be automatically accounted for in the above mentioned finite element formulation by using an expression for the elastic forces obtained with a general continuum mechanics approach. The Hill equation that governs the vibration of the rotating beam is obtained in terms of a set of generalized coordinates that describe the beam displacements and slopes. Under the assumption of small deformation, the Hill equation is linearized, and the complete solution is obtained and used to demonstrate analytically that such a solution does not exhibit instabilities as the angular velocity of the beam increases. The results obtained using this finite element procedure are compared with the results reported in the literature.},

In multibody dynamics the effect has attracted attention only recently.  The objective of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the modelling of geometric stiffening in multibody system simulation.  Today's methods for modelling the effect assume that the (applied) stresses in a flexible system body are zero in its reference configuration, in which it performs large overall motions.  The corresponding inertial loads are shown to be balanced by constraint stresses.  This can be seen easily when formulating the system equations of motion for non-zero reference stresses.  As a result one obtains an efficient alternative to compute the geometric stiffening terms.  The method increases the generality of flexible body models for multibody system simulation.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of turbulent shear flows have shown that many of their important kinematical and dynamical properties can be more clearly understood by describing the flows in terms of individual events or streamline patterns. These events or flow regions are studied because they are associated with relatively large contributions to certain average properties of the flow, for example kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, or to particular processes in the flow, such as mixing and chemical reactions, which may be concentrated at locations where streamlines converge for fast chemical reactions (referred to as convergence or C regions), or in recirculating eddying regions for slow chemical reactions. The aim of this project was to use the numerical simulations to develop suitable criteria for defining these eddying or vortical zones. The C and streaming (S) zones were defined in order to define the whole flow field. It is concluded that homogeneous and sheared turbulent flow fields are made up of characteristic flow zones: eddy, C, and S zones. A set of objective criteria were found which describe regions in which the streamlines circulate, converge or diverge, and form high streams of high velocity flow.}

  abstract = {Considerable confusion surrounds the longstanding question of what constitutes a vortex, especially in a turbulent how. This question, frequently misunderstood as academic, has recently acquired particular significance since coherent structures (CS) in turbulent flows are now commonly regarded as vortices. An objective definition of a vortex should permit the use of vortex dynamics concepts to educe CS, to explain formation and evolutionary dynamics of CS, to explore the role of CS in turbulence phenomena, and to develop viable turbulence models and control strategies for turbulence phenomena. We propose a definition of a vortex in an incompressible flow in terms of the eigenvalues of the symmetric tenser S-2+Omega(2); here S and Omega are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tenser del u. This definition captures the pressure minimum in a plane perpendicular to the vortex axis at high Reynolds numbers, and also accurately defines vortex cores at low Reynolds numbers, unlike a pressure-minimum criterion. We compare our definition with prior schemes/definitions using exact and numerical solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for a variety of laminar and turbulent flows. In contrast to definitions based on the positive second invariant of del u or the complex eigenvalues of del u, our definition accurately identifies the vortex core in flows where the vortex geometry is intuitively clear.}

  abstract = {The most widely used definitions of a vortex are not objective: they identify different structures as vortices in frames that rotate relative to each other. Yet a frame-independent vortex definition is essential for rotating flows and for flows with interacting vortices. Here we define a vortex as a set of fluid trajectories along which the strain acceleration tensor is indefinite over directions of zero strain. Physically, this objective criterion identifies vortices as material tubes in which material elements do not align with directions suggested by the strain eigenvectors. We show using examples how this vortex criterion outperforms earlier frame-dependent criteria. As a side result, we also obtain an objective criterion for hyperbolic Lagrangian structures.}

Wind turbine aerodynamics is the most central discipline for design and construction of wind turbine blades. Here we give a status of the most important research areas within the aerodynamics of wind turbines, rotor wakes, and wind farms. This includes an introduction to basic rotor models, such as the blade-element momentum theory, vortex models, numerical actuator disk models, and computational fluid dynamics. Furthermore, a description is given of the optimization of wind turbine rotors with respect to minimizing the cost of energy produced by wind turbines. Finally, an introduction to the prediction of aerodynamic noise from wind turbine rotors is carried out. "

  abstract = {A limitation of the standard Blade Element Momentum (BEM) technique is that it represents the surface loading by an averaged value determined by locally computed airfoil characteristics. Thus, it does not take into account the chord wise distribution of the induction. Likewise, lifting line methods suffer from the problem that the induction from the free wake vortices is only evaluated along a line representing the center of pressure. Hence, the effect from the chord wise distribution of the induction is neglected. As a consequence, the loading in the proximity of the tip is generally found to be overestimated. To remedy this problem, a correction has been developed, which modifies the circulation by taking into account the additional influence of the induction of the free wake vortices. This is done by correcting the circulation, using the so-called decambering effect and thin-airfoil theory. The correction is implemented as an additional correction to the Prandtl tip correction. Where the Prandtl tip correction serves to correct the axisymmetric momentum theory for a finite number of blades (see Goldstein, 1929), the new model further corrects the blade element model to represent the line distribution by a surface loading. Comparing computations of the new model with results from a 'standard' BEM model and computations using a 3D panel code, show that the inclusion of the correction greatly improves the results. The new model also explains some of the discrepancies that earlier on have been observed when using a BEM technique based alone upon standard tip corrections (Shen et al., 2005).},

The first method is a self-adaptive, fully numerical method based on special copy formulas of Gaussian quadrature rules. The singularity is treated by refining the partitions of the copy formula in the vicinity of the singular point. The second method is a semianalytic method based on asymptotic considerations. Under the small curvature hypothesis, asymptotic expansions are derived for the integrals that are involved in the calculation of the scalar potential, the velocity as well as the deformation field induced from curved quadrilateral surface elements. Compared to other methods, the proposed integration schemes, when applied to practical flow field calculations, require less computational effort.}

The panel code is intended as a design and research tool to capture the 3D nature of a VAWT and its wake. The model contains methods to realistically treat blade-wake interactions, vortex stretching/contraction and viscous diffusion. Validation is demonstrated by comparison with 3D-stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and smoke trail studies for a straight-bladed VAWT. New insight into the near wake structure of a VAWT is developed in addition to how this structure changes as a function of tip speed ratio and height-diameter ratio. Tip vortex dynamics are also discussed.}

  abstract = {The electromotive force (emf) in a loop outside an infinite solenoid with changing current is usually calculated using the vector potential because the magnetic field outside an infinite solenoid is supposed to be zero. However, the magnetic field will only be zero for steady currents. A change in the applied voltage will give rise to a change in the current, which will propagate along the solenoid in the same way as a wave on a transmission line. This gives rise to a transient magnetic field outside the solenoid. It is quite possible to calculate this transient magnetic field and use it in Faraday's law to calculate the emf directly without using the vector potential. In practice, it is usually simpler to use the vector potential. However, care should be taken to ensure that students are not given the impression that there is no magnetic field and that it is the vector potential that acts on charges in the loop. We give examples of the magnetic field configuration outside an infinite solenoid for a steplike change in driving voltage and for an ac driving voltage. (C) 1996 American Teachers.}

The main numerical parameters in the vortex-blob method are the density of the vortices, and the distribution of vorticity within each vortex core. The growth rate of a periodic unstable mode of the shear layer was calculated numerically and compared with the exact result. The error is only a few percent for about 10 rows of vortex blobs. The error is reduced by decreasing the spacing between vortices and, correspondingly, the core size. In the simulation of the motion of the elliptical vortex, the rotation of the boundary, without change of shape, and the circular particle paths of the vortical fluid were well simulated. For the circular vortex, optimum sets of parameters were obtained by comparing them with the exact velocity. The results are consistent with convergence theories of the vortex-blob method. In particular, second-order convergence is observed with a Gaussian core from velocity calculation.}

Evolution of the sheet, which is embedded in a two-dimensional flow, is described by approximating the total circulation between a fixed material point and an imaginary point on the curve of the flow. A linear dispersion relation is defined which shows that the short wavelength modes of the sheet are not unstable and therefore do adversely effect the computations as artifacts of round-off errors. The desingularization approach is demonstrated to converge beyond the critical time for the vortex sheet. Application of the technique for the study of the vortex sheet shed from an elliptically loaded wing is indicated.}

For computational efficiency, this core size needs to be spatially variable as particles are used to discretize different parts of the flow field, such as the boundary layer and the wake in bluff body flows. We derive here a consistent approximation for the viscous Navier-Stokes equations using variable size vortex particles. This derivation is based on the implementation of mappings that allow the consistent formulation of the diffusion and convection operators of the Navier-Stokes equations in the context of vortex methods. Several local mappings can be combined giving the capability of "mesh-embedding" to vortex methods. It is shown that the proposed variable method offers a significant improvement on the computational efficiency of constant core size methods while maintaining the adaptive character of the method. The method is ideally suited to flows such as wakes and shear layers and the validity of the approach is illustrated by showing results from cylinder flows and wall-vortex interactions. Using this scheme, previously unattainable simulations of cylinders undergoing rotary oscillations at high Reynolds numbers reveal an interesting mechanism for drastic drag reduction.

  abstract = {A new combination of vortex-in-cell and parallel fast multipole methods is presented which allows to efficiently simulate, in parallel, unbounded and half-unbounded vortical flows (flows with one flat wall). In the classical vortex-in-cell (VIC) method, the grid used to solve the Poisson equation is typically taken much larger than the vorticity field region, so as to be able to impose suitable far-field boundary conditions and thus approximate the truly unbounded (or half-unbounded) flow; an alternative is to assume periodicity. This approach leads to a solution that depends on the global grid size and, for large problems, to unmanageable memory and CPU requirements. The idea exploited here is to work on a domain that contains tightly the vorticity field and that can be decomposed in several subdomains on which the exact boundary conditions are obtained using the parallel fast multipole (PFM) method. This amounts to solving a 3-D Poisson equation without requiring any iteration between the subdomains (e.g., no Schwarz iteration required): this is so because the PFM method has a global view of the entire vorticity field and satisfies the far-field condition. The solution obtained by this VIC–PFM combination then corresponds to the simulation of a truly unbounded (or half-unbounded) flow. It requires far less memory and leads to a far better computational efficiency compared to simulations done using either (1) the VIC method alone, or (2) the vortex particle method with PFM solver alone. 3-D unbounded flow validation results are presented: instability, non-linear evolution and decay of a vortex ring (first at a moderate Reynolds number using the sequential version of the method, then at a high Reynolds number using the parallel version); instability and non-linear evolution of a two vortex system in ground effect. Finally, a space-developing simulation of an aircraft vortex wake in ground effect is also presented.[All rights reserved Elsevier].}

In this study we present diagnostics such as energy spectra and enstrophy as computed by both methods as well as point-wise comparisons of the vorticity field. Using a fourth order accurate kernel for interpolation between the particles and the mesh, the results of the hybrid vortex method and of the pseudo-spectral method agree well in both flow cases. For the Taylor-Green vortex, the vorticity contours computed by both methods around the time of the energy dissipation peak overlap. The energy spectrum shows that only the smallest length scales in the flow are not captured by the vortex method. In the second flow case, where we compute the collision of two anti-parallel vortex tubes at Reynolds number 10,000, the vortex method results and the pseudo-spectral method results are in very good agreement up to and including the first reconnection of the tubes. The maximum error in the effective viscosity is about 2.5% for the vortex method and about 1% for the pseudo-spectral method. At later times the flows computed with the different methods show the same qualitative features, but the quantitative agreement on vortical structures is lost. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A novel technique is implemented to resolve diffusion effects and enforce the no-slip boundary condition.

The rate of generation of vorticity is shown to be the relative tangential acceleration of fluid and boundary without taking viscosity into account and the generating mechanism therefore involves the tangential pressure gradient within the fluid and the external acceleration of the boundary only. The mechanism is inviscid in nature and independent of the no-slip condition at the boundary, although viscous diffusion acts immediately after generation to spread vorticity outward from boundaries. Vorticity diffuses neither out of boundaries nor into them, and the only means of decay is by cross-diffusive annihilation within the fluid}

The grid-free nature of vortex methods is fully retained and the distribution of the vortices can be irregular. It is shown for the Stokes equations that in principle, the method can have any order of accuracy. It also conserves circulation, linear, and angular momentum. The method is based on exchanging a conserved quantity between arbitrary computational points. This suggests that extensions to more general flows may be possible. For the two-dimensional incompressible flows studied, circulation is exchanged between vortices to simulate diffusion. The amounts of circulation exchanged must satisfy a linear system of equations. Based on stability considerations, the exchanged amounts should further be positive. A procedure to find a solution to this problem is formulated using linear programming techniques. To test the method, the decay processes of a single point Vortex and of a counterrotating pair of point vortices are computed. Current limitations of the method are discussed.

Merging of two strained vortices is studied over a range of Reynolds numbers Re = Γ/2πv = 10-1280, and the results are used to calculate an energy spectrum for three-dimensional, homogeneous turbulence. The cancellation of two strained vortices with opposing circulation is investigated for Reynolds numbers Re = Γ0/2πv = 0.1-160 (Γ0 is the circulation about one vortex), over a range of strain rates in the direction parallel to the line joining the vortex centres. A solution of the Navier-Stokes equations describing vorticity cancellation in the strain-induced collision of vortex layers (Kambe 1984) is used to estimate the asymptotic, timewise decay of circulation for each vortex. Good agreement with the present numerical results is obtained. Vortex core pressures calculated during the cancellation event are compared to a simple analytical model based on Moore & Saffman (1971).}

To perform simulations with nonuniform resolution, a mapping of the redistribution lattice is used. Computational efficiency is attained through the use of parallel tree codes based on multipole expansions of vortex particles and of vortex panels. The method is validated, by comparisons with other authors' results, on the flow past a sphere at Re = 300. It is then applied to compute the flow at Re = 500 and 1000.

The numerical scheme belongs to an adaptive, Lagrangian class of field methods in which computational effort is concentrated in zones of finite vorticity and chemical reaction. We use the low Mach number approximation of combustion and restrict our attention to the case of diffusion flames with no heat release. A single-step, second-order, infinite-rate kinetics chemical reaction model is employed. The scheme is applied to study the effect of flow-induced instabilities on the reaction field in a temporal shear layer. Results are obtained in the high Peclet number regime for a wide range of Damkohler numbers. Changes in the reaction field are related to either the entrainment or the strain field associated with the saturation of the instabilities. With increasing Damkohler number, the reaction region changes from a distributed zone embedded within spanwise and streamwise vortices to a thin sheet surrounding their cores. The product concentration always exhibits strong similarity to the vorticity distribution, realizing its highest values in zones of high vorticity and falling rapidly in regions where the vorticity is small. Variation of the Peclet number yields minor changes in the product distribution and in the reaction zone structure, but strongly affects product formation rates.}

Analysis of the linearized residual operator establishes the uniform convergence of this method when the exact flow field is known. A sequence of examples demonstrates the sensitivity of the method to numerical parameters as the computed solution converges to the exact solution. These experimental results agree with the linear convergence theory.

A rough estimation of the dissipative effect during Vortex reconnection has shown a finite viscous effect that is implicitly present in the model, growing with stretching, representing the mechanism of shifting to reconnected topologies without observing strong velocity gradients. The dividing vorton method is rearranged in order to allow the quantized reproduction of a predefined core evolution law, an error estimation, due to the corpuscularity of the field, is given. Two different numerical computations are performed corresponding to a weak and a strong vortex interaction.

Vortex elements are transported in Lagrangian coordinates, and vorticity is redistributed, when necessary, among larger number of elements arranged along its direction. The accuracy and convergence of the method are investigated by comparing numerical solutions to analytical results on the propagation and stability of vortex rings. Accurate discretization of the initial vorticity field is shown to be essential for the prediction of the linear growth of azimuthal instability waves on vortex rings. The unstable mode frequency, growth rate and shape are in agreement with analytical results. The late stages of evolution of the instability show the generation of small scales in the form of hair-pin vortex structures.

  abstract = {The dynamic model for large-eddy simulation of turbulence samples information from the resolved velocity field in order to optimize subgrid-scale model coefficients. When the method is used in conjunction with the Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity model, and the sampling process is formulated in a spatially local fashion, the resulting coefficient field is highly variable and contains a significant fraction of negative values. Negative eddy viscosity leads to computational instability and as a result the model is always augmented with a stabilization mechanism. In most applications the model is stabilized by averaging the relevant equations over directions of statistical homogeneity. While this approach is effective, and is consistent with the statistical basis underlying the eddy-viscosity model, it is not applicable to complex-geometry inhomogeneous flows. Existing local formulations, intended for inhomogeneous flows, are most commonly stabilized by artificially constraining the coefficient to be positive. In this paper we introduce a new dynamic model formulation, that combines advantages of the statistical and local approaches. We propose to accumulate the required averages over flow pathlines rather than over directions of statistical homogeneity. This procedure allows the application of the dynamic model with averaging to inhomogeneous flows in complex geometries. We analyse direct numerical simulation data to document the effects of such averaging on the Smagorinsky coefficient. The characteristic Lagrangian time scale over which the averaging is performed is chosen based on measurements of the relevant Lagrangian autocorrelation functions, and on the requirement that the model be purely dissipative, guaranteeing numerical stability when coupled with the Smagorinsky model. The formulation is tested in forced and decaying isotropic turbulence and in fully developed and transitional channel flow. In homogeneous flows, the results are similar to those of the volume-averaged dynamic model, while in channel flow, the predictions are slightly superior to those of the spatially (planar) averaged dynamic model. The relationship between the model and vortical structures in isotropic turbulence, as well as ejection events in channel flow, is investigated. Computational overhead is kept small (about 10% above the CPU requirements of the spatially averaged dynamic model) by using an approximate scheme to advance the Lagrangian tracking through first-order Euler time integration and linear interpolation in space.}

In addition, the computed value of the dynamic model coefficient is in good agreement with predictions based on enstrophy balances. Finally, the direct numerical simulation data is used to compare a three-dimensional particle representation of the model with spectral evaluations.

The scheme combines a 3D, adaptive, viscous, vortex element method with a dynamic eddy viscosity model of the subfilter scale stresses. The vortex method is based on discretization of the vorticity field into Lagrangian vortex elements and transport of the elements along particle trajectories. The computations incorporate a mesh redistribution algorithm which creates new elements in regions of high strain and locally redistributes the vorticity field into a smaller number of elements when particles tend to cluster. The subfilter scale vorticity model consists of approximating the effect of unresolved vorticity stresses using a gradient-diffusion eddy viscosity model, following the development in Part I (J. R.

Computations of ring collisions show that, combined, the mesh redistribution scheme and subfilter scale model result in a robust scheme that can be extended into the late stages of evolution of the flow. In addition, it is shown that the Lagrangian LES scheme captures several experimentally observed features of the ring collisions, including turbulent breakdown into small-scale structures and the generation of small-scale radially propagating vortex rings.

In this article we review Lagrangian, multiresolution, particle methods such as vortex methods and smooth particle hydrodynamics for the simulation of continuous flows and molecular dynamics for the simulation of flows at the atomistic scale. We review hybrid molecular-continuum simulations with an emphasis on the computational aspects of the problem.

  abstract = {Subgrid-scale (SGS) models for large-eddy simulation (LES) having the formalism of an effective eddy-viscosity model, but that operates on a modified velocity field, are further evaluated and new ones are proposed. The modified field is obtained using regular filtering of the LES field carried out in physical space. This is actually done by using a discrete and compact operator (only using nearest neighbors values), eventually iterated; this ensures that the proper filtering behavior is preserved, even for near wall points. The first model investigated here is inspired by the variational multiscale approach originally proposed by T. J. Hughes [Phys. Fluids 13, 505 (2001)]. Here, the modelling is simplified, leading to a SGS viscosity effect operating on the "small-scale LES field" that is obtained by subtracting the LES field from its filtered counterpart. Such a model (here called RVMM for short) was already proposed and partially evaluated {e.g., see G. S. Winckelmans and H. Jeanmart [Direct and Large-Scale Eddy Simulation IV (Kluwer, Dordrecht, 2001)] and H. Jeanmart and G. S. Winckelmans (CTR Proceedings of the Summer Program, 2002), the "model M2" of A. W. Vreman [Phys. Fluids 15, L61 (2003)], the "high-pass filtered Smagorinsky model" of S. Stolz [Direct and Large-Eddy Simulation V (Kluwer, Dordrecht, 2004) and Phys. Fluids 17, 065103 (2005)]}. The other model investigated here is an "enhanced field model" (EFM). The SGS viscosity model then operates on a LES field that is artificially enhanced at the small scales; that obtained by adding to the LES field the small-scale field. The two model families are presented in a unified way; they have a behavior that combines viscous and hyperviscous effects, while remaining simple and practical. They however do not naturally have the proper y(3) near wall behavior for the SGS dissipation; hence, they need some near wall damping. To ensure the proper near-wall behavior, we use here the dynamic procedure (self-consistent for each model). The performance of both models is compared to that of other models (also dynamic): the Smagorinsky model, hyperviscosity models, and a hybrid model combining explicitly a Smagorinsky term and a hyperviscosity term. The cases here investigated are LES of decaying isotropic turbulence starting at Re-lambda=90 and LES of turbulent channel flow at Re-tau=395. A good behavior of the RVMM and EFM, as compared to the others, is observed in all cases. They constitute an easily implemented and better alternative than the dynamic Smagorinsky model.

The objective of this work is to provide useful results about the behavior of the subgrid scale (SGS) models and, in particular, their asymptotic behavior. Such information is indeed important for practitioners using LES to simulate truly high Reynolds number flows. Specifically, we consider LES of homogeneous isotropic turbulence at very high Re and where the LES cutoff (here the grid Δ) is taken well into the inertial range (i.e., Δ/η≥100 with η the Kolmogorov scale). Large LES grids (1283 and 2563) are also used in order to compare and attain the true asymptotic behavior of each SGS model, something not fully observable in LES on smaller grids. An analysis is also carried out to obtain the scale dependence of each model coefficient in the viscous range of turbulence using LES run on several grids and compared to direct numerical simulation. The results provide C for each model and for various Δ/ η. A convenient fit then also provides C/C∞ as a function of Δ/η, where C∞ is the asymptotic coefficient. The comparisons are supported using the evolution of resolved energy (global and spectrum), resolved enstrophy, and effective dissipation. It is shown that the multiscale models acting on the high wavenumber part of the LES field are indeed able to provide a significant k-5/3 inertial subrange, yet it is always followed by an energy pileup effect also called "bottleneck." This effect is also characterized for the various models. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

We analyze the generators performance, unsteady power, loads and aerodynamics they are subjected to. The average flow field of the wakes is also computed and turbulence statistics are extracted.

The atmospheric fields are first generated using large-eddy simulations of forced and stratified turbulence reaching a statistically stationary state. The obtained fields are shown to be realistic and consistent with the literature. A pair of counter-rotating vortices, with relatively tight cores, is then put in the obtained fields and evolved. The evolution of the wake vortex topology, transport, and decay is analyzed in depth by measuring the wake vortex characteristics in all cross planes. The vortex transport and deformation are related to the stratification and turbulence levels. Stratification combined with weak turbulence is seen to strongly affect the Crow instability development. Different decay mechanisms are identified, related to the interactions with the turbulence, the turbulent baroclinic vorticity, and/or between the vortices themselves. Finally, improved simplified models of vortex altitude evolution and of vortex decay (with two phases) are proposed and calibrated on the present results. They yield good agreement with the large-eddy simulation results and are usefully integrated in our operational models.},

  abstract = {The study of decaying isotropic turbulent flow is an important point of reference for turbulence theories and numerical simulations. For the past several decades, most experimental results appear to favor power-law decay with exponents between -1.2 and -1.4, approximately. More recently, studies of fractal-generated turbulence with multi-scale passive grids have shown increased Reynolds numbers and exponential or very fast power-law decays following an increase of kinetic energy close to the grid. Other recent studies have confirmed that such non-classical decay is limited to the region near the grid. In order to generate turbulence with multi-scale injection of kinetic energy at more elevated Reynolds numbers and with more spatially homogeneous distributions than available in prior experiments, we use an activegrid consisting of winglets with fractal shapes. We consider various types of fractal winglets, namely, Sierpinski triangle, space-filling squares, and Apollonian gasket type fractal shapes. Regular non-fractal winglets are also considered. Passive fractal grids are studied by keeping the winglets locked in place. Data are acquired using X-wire thermal anemometry and the decay is analyzed between 15 < x/M < 50 (M is the mesh-size). Results exhibit power-law decay with decay exponent approximately between -1.0 and -1.3. The precise values of the decay exponent and the coefficient C<sub>ε</sub> = εℓ/u<sub>rms</sub>³ depend on the geometry of the initial condition, although it is not possible to discern systematic or monotonic trends with respect to ReMsub>λ</sub>, component anisotropy, grid fractal dimension, or blockage ratio.}

The induction zone can directly affect lidar measurements and presents an opportunity for further decorrelation between upstream wind and the wind that interacts with the rotor. The impact of the induction zone is investigated using the combined CFD and aeroelastic code SOWFA. Lidar measurements are simulated upstream of a 5 MW turbine rotor and the true wind disturbances are found using a wind speed estimator and turbine outputs. Lidar performance in the absence of an induction zone is determined by simulating lidar measurements and the turbine response using the aeroelastic code FAST with wind inputs taken far upstream of the original turbine location in the SOWFA wind field. Results indicate that while measurement quality strongly depends on the amount of wind evolution, the induction zone has little effect. However, the optimal lidar preview distance and circular scan radius change slightly due to the presence of the induction zone.},

The computer cost is only of the order of the 3/2 power on N, instead of N-squared, for each step with N vortices. Arbitrary shapes can be treated; a conformal mapping is not required. Special attention is paid to the viscous character of the solution and to the accurate computation of the pressure distribution at the body surface.

Accurate electrostatic computations were done on a 3(8) x 3(8) x 3(8) region of 100000-particle unit cells, giving a volume of 28 quadrillion particles at less than a twofold cost over computing the forces and potentials in the unit cell alone. In practice, a k = 4 ... 6 simulation approximates the true infinite lattice Ewald sum forces (including the shape-dependent dipole correction) to high accuracy, taking 25-30 % more time to compute than only the unit cell. The method extends to noncubic unit cell shapes, and noncubic macroscopic shapes. Simple code modifications allowed computation of forces within macroscopic spheres and ellipsoids, and within near-infinite square, circular, and elliptical surfaces formed of unit cubes replicated along Two of the three axes. In addition to efficient periodic simulations, the method provides a powerful tool to study limiting behavior of various finite crystal shapes, as well as surface phenomena in molecular dynamics simulations.

Two main difficulties preventing the even more widespread use of these codes are the limitations on the number of discretization elements and the user expertise and effort required to specify the wake location. In the paper we present an automatic wake generation strategy for a potential flow solver, and accelerate the method using a pFFT-Fast Multipole Tree algorithm. The combined method can be used to simulate both steady and unsteady flows. The steady state solution is achieved by running an unsteady flow simulation until it reaches a steady state. Computation results are given to demonstrate that the method is fast enough to automatically simulate entire heaving and flapping wing crafts in under and hour on a desktop computer.

This model can be expressed in Hamiltonian form and that it shows many analogies with similar systems in plasma physics. In addition to the standard mesh techniques, a computational description can be obtained if the continuous vorticity distribution is replaced by a finite set of point vortices interacting through a stream function which satisfies Poisson's equation. The point vortices move in a velocity field given on a Cartesian mesh such that there is a close resemblance to particle models used in plasma simulations. The point vortex model is presented with a calculation on a test model and the sources of numerical errors are explained. It is concluded that the point vortex model is useful and versatile for a variety of problems in hydrodynamics as well as in plasma physics}

Our method is a finite difference analogue of Anderson's Method of Local Corrections. The solution is computed in three steps. First, fine-grid solutions are computed in parallel using, infinite domain boundary conditions on each subdomain. Second, information is transferred globally through a coarse-grid representation of the charge, and a global coarse-grid solution is found. Third, a fine-grid solution is computed on each subdomain using boundary conditions set with the global coarse solution, corrected locally with fine-grid information from nearby subdomains. There are three important features of our algorithm. First, our method requires only a single iteration between the local fine-grid solutions and the global coarse representation. Second, the error introduced by the domain decomposition is small relative to the solution error obtained in a single-grid calculation. Third, the computed solution is second-order accurate and only weakly dependent on the coarse-grid spacing and the number of subdomains. As a result of these features, we are able to compute accurate solutions in parallel with a much smaller ratio of communication to computation than more traditional domain decomposition methods. We present results to verify the overall accuracy, confirm the small communication costs, and demonstrate the parallel scalability of the method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Current integral equation methods for the Dirichlet problem, however, require the solution of M independent problems of dimension N, where M is the number of boundary components and N is the total number of points in the discretization. The authors present a new boundary integral equation approach, valid for both interior and exterior problems, which requires the solution of a single linear system of dimension N+M.

This presents a challenge to traditional Eulerian computational methods, as fine grids are required to suppress numerical diffusion which would weaken the vortex cores after a small number of revolutions. Vortex methods have been used in the past to overcome these problems, as they require computational elements only in vorticity-containing regions, but suffer from greater computational cost per element. In the present work, we will solve these problems with a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian method for modeling rotor wakes. An Eulerian OVERFLOW overset grid method computes the near-body flow, while a Lagrangian particle vortex method tracks the wake. The vortex method uses an anisotropic LES model to handle subgrid-scale dissipation explicitly. The computational cost of vortex methods is alleviated by using a parallel adaptive treecode on a cluster of machines each with multi-core CPUs and multiple cost-efficient graphics processing units (GPUs). Simulations of a low-Re sphere, finite wing, and 4-bladed rotor model are presented and are validated by comparisons with computational and experimental data. © 2010 by Applied Scientific Research, Inc.}

However the use of BEM entails several semi-empirical corrections and add-ons that need reconsideration and recalibration when new features appear. For floating wind turbines, the effect of the floater motions is such a new feature. In the present paper, this aspect is investigated by comparing BEM based results against 3D free-wake simulations. Deterministic as well as stochastic simulations are presented in pure aerodynamic and full aeroelastic context. It is confirmed that asymmetric inflow originating from yaw misalignment and shear give significant differences reflected on mean values and amplitudes.},

The approach proposed is based on a volume discretization of the vortex vector which, in three-dimensional flow, will vary with time as a function of the local distortions of the velocity field in order to respect the conservation theorems pertaining to vortex flows. The Lagrangian integro-differential formulation is established that allows the evolution in time to be followed of a discrete distribution of fluid particles, each carrying a vortex vector. The numerical process is applied to the calculation of the sheet and of the aerodynamic coefficients of a low aspect ratio, rectangular flat plate.}

The solution takes the contraction of the slipstream fully into account. The method is an extension of the analytical theory of Conway (1995) for the linearized actuator disk and is exact for an incompressible perfect fluid. The solutions for the velocities and stream function are given as one-dimensional integrals of expressions containing complete elliptic integrals. Any load distribution with bounded radial gradient can be treated. Results are presented here for both contra-rotating and normal propellers. For the special case of a contra-rotating propeller with a parabolic velocity profile in the ultimate wake, the vorticity in the slipstream is shown to be the same as in the analytically tractable spherical vortex of Hill (1894) and the related family of steady vortices explored by Fraenkel (1970, 1972) and Norbury (1973).}

  abstract = {A general momentum theory for an energy-extracting actuator disc modelling a rotor with a multiplicity of blades having radially uniform circulation is presented that includes the effects of wake rotation and expansion. A parallel theory directed at the propeller has been published elsewhere, but not one intended for the wind turbine. The rotation of the wake is shown to be accompanied by a fall in static pressure that is additional to that which occurs across the actuator disc and accounts for the energy extraction from the wind. Energy extraction is recognized in the fully developed wake by the flow regaining the static pressure of the undisturbed wind at the expense of the kinetic energy in the wake. Because the wake is still rotating in the fully developed wake, the additional fall in static pressure appears there also and so does not augment the energy extraction. However, the additional fall in pressure would cause a discontinuity in pressure across the fully developed wake but is prevented by a further slowing down of the wake. The additional slowing down extracts a little more energy from the flow than that predicted by the simple momentum theory, which does not include wake rotation. The overall effect of wake rotation on energy extraction is very small for wind turbines operating at high tip speed ratios but can significantly increase the predicted power output for turbines operating at low tip speed ratios.

  abstract = {The classical momentum theory for actuator discs with a constant normal load Deltap addresses only the axial momentum balance. Now the radial balance is also derived, which, in the absence of a radial disc load, leads to the requirement that the integral of the static pressure along the disc centre line must be zero. The axial and radial balances appear to be mutually inconsistent. the axial balance provides the well-known results, but the radial balance cannot be satisfied. The inconsistency can be removed by assuming that the actuator disc force held is composed of more than the constant normal load Deltap. It is shown that the modelling by Lee and Greenberg (Journal of Fluid Mechanics 1984, 745:287) of the load and flow of an actuator strip in hover implies the existence of a singular suction force at the edge. Their results deviate, without explanation so for, from the predictions of classical momentum theory. Addition of this edge force to the radial and axial momentum balances provides consistent results. A more general explanation or solution for the inconsistency is not yet ore cable. Comparison the present inviscid analysis with a Navier-Stokes calculation by Mikkelsen et al. (Wind Energy 200 1; 4:12 1) shows that the integrated pressure along the disc centre line is indeed non-zero, but that the radial balance is still satisfied. It is not clear why this deviates from the analysis. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The use of the Helmholtz decomposition for exterior incompressible viscous flows is examined, with special emphasis on the issue of the boundary conditions for the vorticity. The problem is addressed by using the decomposition for the infinite space; that is, by using a representation for the velocity that is valid for both the fluid region and the region inside the boundary surface. The motion of the boundary is described as the limiting case of a sequence of impulsive accelerations. It is shown that at each instant of velocity discontinuity, vorticity is generated by the boundary condition on the normal component of the velocity, for both inviscid and viscous flows. In viscous flows, the vorticity is then diffused into the surroundings: this yields that the no-slip conditions are thus automatically satisfied (since the presence of a vortex layer on the surface is required to obtain a velocity slip at the boundary). This result is then used to show that in order for the solution to the Euler equations to be the limit of the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, a trailing-edge condition (that the vortices be shed as soon as they are formed) must be satisfied. The use of the results for a computational scheme is also discussed. Finally, Lighthill's transpiration velocity is interpreted in terms of Helmholtz decomposition, and extended to unsteady compressible flows.},

abstract = "Abstract This paper is the first of two papers on the history of rotor aerodynamics with special emphasis on the role of Joukowsky. The present one focuses on the development of the momentum theory while the second one surveys the development of vortex theory for rotors. Joukowsky has played a major role in these developments. Although he cooperated with other famous aerodynamicists like Prandtl, his contribution is not well recognized as most of his publications are in Russian. The paper discusses the role of the English, Russian and German research schools in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, and the contributions by individual researchers like Lanchester, Prandtl, Betz and Joukowsky himself. After the one-dimensional momentum theory was well established, the introduction of torque and angular momentum was the next step. Joukowsky has led the basis for this step, but Glauert׳s Blade Element Momentum still is the basis of current rotor design codes. He applied some assumptions limiting the validity to moderate and high tip speed ratios. S{\o}rensen and van Kuik published a solution for wind turbines with very low tip speed ratios, which is now expanded to propellers as well, with one remaining assumption of inviscid flow. For very low tip speed ratios the general momentum theory gives unphysical results which disappear after applying a perturbation parameter representing phenomena not captured by the Euler equations.

This article considers rotors with finite number of blades and is subtitled “Vortex theories”. The first article with subtitle “Momentum theories”, assessed the starring role of Joukowsky in aerodynamics in the historical context of rotor theory. The main focus in both articles is on wind turbine rotors, but much of the basic theory applies to propellers and helicopters as well. Thus this second article concentrates on the so-called blade element theory, the Kutta–Joukowsky theorem, and the development of the rotor vortex theory of Joukowsky. This article is to a large extent based on our own work, which constitutes the first successful completion and further development of Joukowsky׳s work by deriving the first analytical solution of his rotor. This rotor has a finite number of blades and will be compared with the rotor analysis of Betz and of others of the German school of aerodynamics. "

  abstract = {The wake of a propeller has tangential as well as longitudinal velocity relative to still air. The coarser the spiral the propeller carves in the air, the greater is the ratio of tangential to longitudinal wake velocity. As aircraft with propellers go faster, designers must use higher and higher ratios of pitch to diameter to keep the propeller tips below, or not too far above, the speed of sound. The higher thrusts required for higher speeds demand higher loading. All wake energy losses will rise, the swirl component more than the longitudinal component. If the longitudinal component of velocity is uniform across a propeller wake, the swirl energy in the wake is exactly paid for by the work done by wake suction. For lightly loaded propellers the longitudinal velocity is always fairly uniform, and the relation between swirl energy and wake suction is a good approximation. Either swirl energy or wake suction may be used to measure swirl loss, but not both at once. It is not their sum.}

The simple analysis remains valid at high tip speed ratio for a sufficiently small core radius of the hub vortex. As the tip speed ratio decreases, the present analysis eventually becomes invalid. It is, however, reasonable to conclude that including the effects of the hub vortex causes the maximum power coefficient to increase above the Lanchester-Betz limit with decreasing tip speed ratio. The extent to which this conclusion depends on the assumed vortex model was investigated briefly by considering a more general model for the hub vortex. The results strongly imply that some account of the vortex structure of the wake will be required to resolve fully the effects of swirl. Unfortunately there are no measurements currently available for the hub vortex.},

Aim of the projects is the definition and implementation of engineering models within the current state-of-the-art computer codes for dynamic load calculations. These models are to be qualified by means of comparison with both existing sophisticated models (dynamic vortex wake calculations) and with experiments to be carried out on the Danish Tjaereborg 2 MW turbine. The paper discusses the first results of the project. Proposed engineering models are presented. Comparisons between results of the proposed models and the free vortex wake model of the University of the Bundeswehr, Munich are shown, for simplified cases, viz. a step on the wind speed and simple pitching transients. Finally, measurements for a pitching transient are shown and compared with calculations. Both measurements and calculations show important effects of dynamic inflow, resulting in large overshoots of loads compared to stationary values. The agreement between measurements and calculations is very encouraging}

  abstract = {This paper investigates wake effects on load and power production by using the dynamic wake meander (DWM) model implemented in the aeroelastic code HAWC2. The instationary wind farm flow characteristics are modeled by treating the wind turbine wakes as passive tracers transported downstream using a meandering process driven by the low frequent cross-wind turbulence components. The model complex is validated by comparing simulated and measured loads for the Dutch Egmond aan Zee wind farm consisting of 36 Vestas V90 turbine located outside the coast of the Netherlands. Loads and production are compared for two distinct wind directionsa free wind situation from the dominating southwest and a full wake situation from northwest, where the observed turbine is operating in wake from five turbines in a row with 7D spacing. The measurements have a very high quality, allowing for detailed comparison of both fatigue and minmeanmax loads for blade root flap, tower yaw and tower bottom bending moments, respectively. Since the observed turbine is located deep inside a row of turbines, a new method on how to handle multiple wakes interaction is proposed. The agreement between measurements and simulations is excellent regarding power production in both free and wake sector, and a very good agreement is seen for the load comparisons too. This enables the conclusion that wake meandering, caused by large scale ambient turbulence, is indeed an important contribution to wake loading in wind farms.

In the present paper, this modeling is extended to include the case of a skewed flow, which is asymmetric. Similar to the axisymmetric case, it is assumed that the pressure difference between both sides of each point of the disk is a time average of the pressure difference between both sides of the blade elements that pass through the same point. The influence of the loaded disk on the flowfield is modeled by a distribution of sinks/sources over the disk plane. Closed-form integral expressions are obtained for the induced velocity through and upstream of the disk. By using Bernoulli's equation, which relates between the flow far upstream and the flow just before crossing the disk plane, an additional nonlinear algebraic equation for the induced-velocity distribution over the disk is obtained. Discretization of the integral equations results in a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. An iterative procedure leads to the final solution. The model is efficient, stable, easy to apply, and solve. Comparisons with results of another method from the literature exhibit a very good agreement.},

  abstract = {This study concerns dynamic stall in a two-dimensional flow, and more precisely the modeling of the global aerodynamic forces by means of differentiel equations derived from wind tunnel tests. The equations were arrived at first by measuring the aerodynamic coefficients on an airfoil subjected to low-amplitude vibrations. When the model took its final form, it was possible to calculate its parameters directly from large-amplitude measurements. The formula proposed here finds the lift, moment and drag for pitching and heaving actions and for a wind speed variation, and has been verified by wind tunnel tests whenever possible. The model equations have a very similar formulation for the three aerodynamic coefficients and are remarkably insensitive to the type of airfoil. They seem to have a character that is both necessary and sufficient for reconstructing the experiment. All of these points conspire to give great confidence in this method, based on experimental data, despite the dispersion encountered in this type of measurement.}

    abstract = {The dynamic stall phenomenon and its importance for load calculations and aeroelastic simulations is well known. Different models exist to model the effect of dynamic stall; however, a systematic comparison is still lacking. To investigate if one is performing better than another, three models are used to simulate the Ohio State University measurements and a set of data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames experimental study of dynamic stall and compare results. These measurements were at conditions and for aerofoils that are typical for wind turbines, and the results are publicly available. The three selected dynamic stall models are the ONERA model, the BeddoesLeishman model and the Snel model. The simulations show that there are still significant differences between measurements and models and that none of the models is significantly better in all cases than the other models. Especially in the deep stall regime, the accuracy of each of the dynamic stall models is limited. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A turbulent inflow with the same spectral characteristics as the atmosphere is produced by introducing time varying body forces in a plane upstream the rotor. The results of the simulation are compared to those obtained on a wind turbine in uniform inflow at the same mean wind speed and from this comparison a number of features of the influence of inflow turbulence on wake dynamics are deduced. Furthermore, the results are used to verify the validity of some of the basic assumptions employed in simpler engineering models and to study their bounds of application. The large amount of data from the wake simulation can easily be used in simple engineering methods to model a wind turbine operating in the wake of an upstream turbine.},

The computed loads as well as the velocity field behind the yawed rotor are compared to detailed pressure and PIV measurements which were carried out in the EU funded MEXICO project. The computed loading follows in general the experimental counterpart in a period of rotation with a slight overprediction on the mean loading which probably is caused by the inaccuracy of the airfoil data. The predicted wake velocity agrees well with the experiments in the near wake region. Computations with the DNW wind tunnel for the yawed rotor are also performed and show that the tunnel effects are very small in the loading and in the near wake field behind the rotor whereas in the far wake region (>1D) the influence becomes important.}

The AL/NS model was combined with a large eddy simulation technique and used to compute the flow past the MEXICO rotor in free air and in the DNW German-Dutch wind tunnel for three commonly defined test cases at wind speeds of 10, 15 and 24?m?s -1. Two sets of airfoil data were used. Comparisons of blade loadings showed that the AL/NS technique with the modified airfoil data is in better agreement with the measurements than with the original 2D airfoil data. Comparisons of detailed near-wake velocities showed good agreement with the measurements. Computations including the influence of the geometry of the wind tunnel showed that tunnel effects are not significant and the effect of the geometry of the wind tunnel only results in a speedup of 3\% at a thrust coefficient of CT ?=},

				The equation describing the rate of change of the mean square vorticity in homogeneous isotropic turbulence is obtained and the terms occurring therein are discussed. A negative contribution to $\overline{d\omega ^{2}}$/dt arises from the effect of viscosity, while a positive contribution is produced by the tendency for the random diffusive motion to extend the vortex lines. This latter contribution can be related to the skewness of the probability distribution of the rate of extension of line elements of the fluid aligned in any given direction. The results of direct measurements of each of the factors appearing in the vorticity equation are then described. The measurements were made by analyzing electrically the output from a hot-wire anemometer placed downstream from a grid in a uniform stream. Both U$^{2}$/$\overline{u^{2}}$ and $\lambda ^{2}$ are found to increase approximately linearly with time during decay of the turbulence and their rates of change are consistent with the energy equation. The skewness factor mentioned above is approximately constant during decay, with the same value at all Reynolds numbers. It follows that the rate of increase of $\overline{\omega ^{2}}$ due to vortex extension is proportional to ($\overline{\omega ^{2}}$)$^{\frac{3}{2}}$, and further measurements show that the effect of viscosity has a similar dependence, so that the ratio of the two contributions to $\overline{d\omega ^{2}}$/dt remains the same throughout the decay. The viscous contribution is always the greater but the contributions tend to equality as the grid Reynolds number increases. The measurements of all terms in the vorticity equation are shown to satisfy the equation with sufficient accuracy. One of the deductions from the measurements is that the double velocity correlation function tends to a cusp at the origin as the Reynolds number increases indefinitely.},

The simulation method is used to obtain 'rotationally sampled' PSDs, which are compared with measurements obtained by Pacific Northwest Laboratories.

  abstract = {Recent developments in LiDAR technology have led to much interest in the possibility of improving turbine control by using a turbine-mounted LiDAR, to provide advance information about the approaching wind field. This could significantly reduce turbine loads, bringing improved cost-effectiveness, especially for large turbines. There have also been claims of direct increases in energy capture as a result of using such preview information. This study reports on an independent study employing detailed analytical methods to evaluate the likely benefits of LiDAR-assisted control and advise LiDAR manufacturers about the characteristics of their systems, which are most likely to be useful for this application. Accurate simulation models are vital for assessing the performance of LiDARs and controllers which use them. Current models use Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis, but this is not strictly valid when LiDAR is used to measure upstream wind speeds, as the measured wind cannot be assumed to convect unchanged to the turbine. A method for avoiding the frozen turbulence assumption is proposed, and simulation results are presented to illustrate the effect on fatigue load reductions which LiDAR-assisted control might achieve. A detailed assessment of possible LiDAR benefits is made using the UPWIND generic 5 MW turbine as an example.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of wake meandering is long known empirically, but has so far not been treated in a satisfactory manner on the wind turbine load modelling side. We present a consistent, physically based theory for wake meandering, which we consider of crucial importance for the overall description of wind turbine loadings in wind farms. In its present version, the model is confined to single wake situations - including a simple heuristic description of wake interaction with a reflecting surface. Contrary to previous attempts to model wind turbine wake loading, the present approach opens for a unifying description in the sense that turbine power and load aspects can be treated simultaneously. This capability is a direct and attractive consequence of the model being based on the underlying physical process, and it potentially opens for optimization of wind farm topology, wind farm operation, as well as control strategies for the individual turbine. The application of the proposed dynamic wake meandering methodology with existing aeroelastic codes is straightforward and does not involve any code modifications. The strategy is simply to embed the combined effect of atmospheric turbulence, added wake turbulence and the intermittent 'turbulence contribution', caused by wake meandering, in files replacing the traditional turbulence file input to aeroelastic computations.

The orientational structure and energetic properties of the liquid have been studied for several choices of Ewald sum parameters. The results, including the dielectric constant ε, the radial-dependent Kirkwood factor GK(r), the orientational projection HΔ(r), and the average dipole interaction energy, are compared with those from molecular dynamics simulations of water using the reaction field method. While the orientational structure of the liquid obtained from simulations which treat long range interactions by Ewald summation is different from corresponding results obtained from simulations with a reaction field, consistent values are calculated for the dielectric constant. The sensitivity of the results to variations in the convergence parameter α, the real-space cutoff Rc, and the number of vectors used in the reciprocal space sum was also analyzed.}
